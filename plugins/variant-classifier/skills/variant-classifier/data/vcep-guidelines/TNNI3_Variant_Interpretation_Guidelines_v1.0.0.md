## Pathogenic Criteria

### PVS1 - Null Variant

**Original ACMG Summary:** Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical +/-1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease.

Caveats:
- Beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g. GFAP, MYH7).
- Use caution interpreting LOF variants at the extreme 3' end of a gene.
- Use caution with splice variants that are predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the protein intact.
- Use caution in the presence of multiple transcripts.

**VCEP Specification: *Not Applicable***

**Comments:** Not currently applicable to TNNI3. See PM4 for truncating variants that do NOT undergo NMD.

**Modification Type:** N/A

---

### PS1 - Same Amino Acid Change

**Original ACMG Summary:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change. Example: Val->Leu caused by either G>C or G>T in the same codon. Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | No cardiomyopathy specifications. Apply as outlined by Richards et al. 2015. |

> **Example of when rule should NOT be applied:** NM_000256.3(*MYBPC3*): c.2308G>A (p.Asp770Asn) has an established impact on splicing leading to nonsense mediated decay (NMD) and should not be used to provide evidence for other variants observed to result in the same amino acid change.

**Modification Type:** No change

---

### PS2 - De Novo (Confirmed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history. Note: Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, etc. can contribute to non-maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:**

Refer to SVI guidance on number/combination of cases required based on phenotype specificity.

For most cardiomyopathies, it is recommended to default to **Phenotype consistency: "Phenotype consistent with gene but not highly specific"**. Clinical judgment is required for shifting to a higher or lower category.

For use as a **STRONG** or **VERY STRONG** criterion, ideally parents have been thoroughly clinically evaluated without evidence of cardiomyopathy (ideally using a combination of ECG and echocardiogram or cardiac MRI for maximum sensitivity).

A family history consistent with *de novo* inheritance should not have any clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiomyopathy in a 1st or 2nd degree relative, for example:
1. Sudden death under 60 years of age
2. Heart transplant
3. Implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) under 60 years of age
4. Features of cardiomyopathy (e.g., systolic dysfunction, hypertrophy, left ventricular enlargement in an individual without risk factors)
5. Other related/overlapping cardiomyopathies

Examples of non-suspicious family history may include non-specific clinical features (e.g., palpitations, syncope, borderline/inconclusive echocardiogram findings, heart attack if age appropriate and suspected to result from coronary artery disease), but every attempt should be made to clarify features.

Generally, this criterion is only applicable in the **ABSENCE** of any other possible disease-causing variants. If other pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants are present, consider decreasing points assigned or overall weight.

> **Distributed-source limitation:** The specification refers readers to SVI guidance for the number/combination of cases and mentions decreasing assigned points, but the distributed TNNI3 package does not include the SVI de novo point matrix or its point-to-strength mapping. No numeric mapping is supplied here.

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### PS3 - Functional Studies

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product. Note: Functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well-established.

**VCEP Specifications:**

Evaluation of studies/assays is required prior to application of functional evidence at any strength. Refer to SVI guidance for functional evidence (Brnich *et al.* 2020). In the context of cardiomyopathy, very few functional assays currently meet criteria sufficient for application of this rule at a STRONG level. Examples of the types of study/assays that MAY be relevant are described, but further definition of cardiomyopathy models/assays is outside the scope of these guidelines.

| Strength | Assay Type | Criteria |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Strong** | In vitro splicing assays (e.g., RNA studies) | May be considered STRONG evidence providing: (1) Prior knowledge of predominant transcripts in cardiac tissue; (2) Analysis using RNA from cardiac tissue of the individual with the variant, OR from whole blood if the relevant transcripts are expressed in blood at sufficient levels; (3) Assay shows a clear, reproducible and convincing effect on splicing (distinct splice product at a level comparable to wild-type), not observed in controls; (4) Confirmation of abnormal splice product by Sanger sequencing. **NOTE:** Mini-gene assay in non-patient derived cell lines are NOT considered STRONG evidence. **NOTE:** Whether to activate this rule needs to be reconciled with the variant spectrum and disease mechanism for the gene at hand (i.e., consider whether the effect is likely to lead to LOF or an in-frame alteration and whether this type of effect is expected to be disease causing). |
| **Moderate** | In vivo models (e.g., variant knock-in animal models) | Mammalian variant-specific knock-in animal models that produce a phenotype consistent with the clinical phenotype in humans (e.g., structural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities, premature death, arrhythmia). **NOTE:** The following do NOT meet criteria: (1) Assays associated with non-specific cardiac phenotypes (e.g., morpholino-induced pericardial edema in zebrafish); (2) In vivo evidence that is not variant specific, such as whole gene alterations (i.e., cDNA or whole gene transgenic mice and whole or partial gene knock-out mice). |
| **Supporting** | In vitro assays (e.g., biochemical assays of myofilament function, motility assays, human iPSC-CM) | While some in vitro assays may provide evidence of an effect on protein and/or myofilament function, at present there are no validated "gold-standard" assays considered to reliably predict the clinical phenotype. Data from individual in vitro studies are unlikely to meet criteria for more than SUPPORTING level. |

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### PS4 - Prevalence in Affected

**Original ACMG Summary:** The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls.

**VCEP Specifications:**

Currently few well-designed case-control studies have been performed for inherited cardiomyopathies. Until such studies become available, comparative analyses can be undertaken using case data (e.g., internal and/or published cohorts) and control data from population-level cohorts (e.g., gnomAD).

#### Cohort Requirements

Cohorts used in these analyses should meet **all** of the following criteria:
1. Cases have a clinical diagnosis of the specified disorder or related phenotype (e.g., all cases have HCM or another relevant phenotype*). Consider how likely another potential cause of the phenotype has been excluded, including the presence of other variants in relevant genes and the extent of testing performed.
2. Controls should not be derived from study populations enriched for the specified disorder.
3. The denominator of the cohorts must be available (e.g., variant detected in 5 out of 3,500 cases and 1 out of 60,000 controls).
4. The cohorts do not include closely related individuals (family members not included in case counts).
5. The cohorts do not overlap with other cohorts being used in the analysis (cases not counted more than once).
6. The population diversity of the case and control cohorts are broadly similar.
7. Consider the size of the case cohort -- larger cohorts provide more accurate variant frequency estimates; prefer data from the largest available case series (e.g., Walsh *et al.* 2017, DECIPHER).

#### PS4 Strength Thresholds (Odds Ratio)

| Strength | OR Threshold (Lower Bound 95% CI) |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| **Strong** | Lower bound of 95% CI of OR **>=20** |
| **Moderate** | Lower bound of 95% CI of OR **>=10** |
| **Supporting** | Lower bound of 95% CI of OR **>=5** |

> A PS4 calculator is available at www.cardiodb.org.

If multiple cohorts are available, the final ORs and associated CIs need to be harmonized across all cohorts to determine the final level (e.g., if 2 large cohorts have an OR of ~6 and a third small cohort has an OR of 11, application at a SUPPORTING level should be considered).

#### *Relevant Phenotypes

1. Cases of HCM and RCM may be combined as they are considered part of the same disease spectrum.
2. For the eight genes covered by these guidelines, the combination of probands with other phenotypes should be reviewed by a clinical expert to determine if grouping is appropriate.
3. **Additional considerations for LVNC and end-stage HCM:**
   - Due to the current debate about whether isolated LVNC represents a true disease entity or variation of typical cardiac morphology, individuals with isolated LVNC should **NOT** be added to proband or segregation counts (including individuals with isolated LVNC in a family with other cardiomyopathies).
   - HCM and DCM have distinct mechanisms of disease and therefore pathogenetic variants are not anticipated to cause both primary phenotypes. While occurrence in both phenotypes may initially be considered as evidence against pathogenicity, end-stage HCM can present similarly to DCM. Careful consideration is needed before including DCM or related phenotypes in case or segregation data for primarily HCM variants.

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### PM1 - Mutational Hot Spot

**Original ACMG Summary:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | Applicable to missense variants in *TNNI3* in the specific regions listed below (Walsh *et al.* 2019): **(1)** Transcripts ENST00000344887 and NM_000363.5; **(2)** **Codons 141-209** |

**Important Notes:**
- Data from HCM case cohorts was used to derive these cluster regions. Therefore, this rule should **NOT** be applied when additional evidence for the variant supports that the variant causes a phenotype other than HCM (e.g., variant seen in multiple DCM cases).
- Enrichment was not observed for DCM in any genes.
- Rule should **NOT** be combined with PM5 because presence of pathogenic variants in the same codon/region were used to determine clustering and would be double-counting evidence.

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific, Gene-specific

---

### PM2 - Absent from Controls

**Original ACMG Summary:** Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium. Caveat: Population data for indels may be poorly called by next generation sequencing.

**VCEP Specification (Supporting only):**

A threshold of **<=0.00004** in the subpopulation with the highest frequency when using the upper bound of the 95% CI activates this rule.

This is equivalent to the variant **NOT** being observed more than once (<=1 allele) in gnomAD v.2.1.1 in one of the non-founder populations (e.g., absence required from the Other and Ashkenazi Jewish subpopulations).

Applying a threshold of <=0.00004 (upper bound of 95% CI) is equivalent to the variant being seen in a single subpopulation meeting any of the following:

| Allele Count (AC) | Allele Number (AN) |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| <=1 | >=120,000 |
| <=2 | >=160,000 |
| <=3 | >=195,000 |
| <=4 | >=230,000 |

**Additional Notes:**
- gnomAD is the preferred database. gnomAD currently only displays the filtering allele frequency (FAF), which is equivalent to a lower bound estimate of the 95% CI, when the upper bound is what is needed. Confidence interval tools, such as Confit-de-MAF, can be used to determine the upper bound.
- Due to current technical limitations of NGS technologies, minor allele frequencies for complex variants (e.g., large indels) may not be accurately represented in population databases.
- Caution should be used when a variant is only identified, or over-represented, in one of the smaller gnomAD populations.
- Population databases may contain affected or pre-symptomatic individuals for diseases with reduced penetrance/variable onset.
- The values used to calculate PM2 thresholds were derived from studies in Northern European populations. These thresholds can be applied to any population where disease prevalence is considered comparable (1/500 or lower), where the most frequent pathogenic variant accounts for no more than 2% of cases, and where the penetrance of a pathogenic variant is expected to be at least 50%.

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### PM3 - In Trans with Pathogenic

**Original ACMG Summary:** For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant. Note: This requires testing of parents (or offspring) to determine phase.

**VCEP Specification: *Not Applicable***

**Comments:** While compound heterozygosity leading to a more severe phenotype has been documented, this rule was designed for traditional recessive inheritance. It is acknowledged that there is increasing evidence supporting that some of these genes/variants may also be recessive (e.g., MYL2, MYL3), but addressing those edge cases was outside the scope of this current guideline.

---

### PM4 - Protein Length Changes

**Original ACMG Summary:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | Strength of rule should be carefully considered and may require downgrading to SUPPORTING based on the predicted impact of the variant, including the size of the deletion/insertion, its location, and conservation of the region. For genes where PVS1 is not applicable (i.e., where there is no evidence that pLOF variants cause disease), consider using this rule at MODERATE or SUPPORTING strength for **truncating variants that do NOT undergo nonsense mediated decay (NMD)**. |

> **Source limitation:** The specification permits downgrading to Supporting based on predicted impact but does not give a separate positive Supporting rule or a threshold for size, location, or conservation.

**Modification Type:** General recommendation

---

### PM5 - Novel Missense at Same Residue

**Original ACMG Summary:** Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before. Example: Arg156His is pathogenic; now you observe Arg156Cys. Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | Can be used at MODERATE if a different missense variant at the same codon has been classified as **pathogenic** using these modified guidelines **without application of PM5**. The impact of the amino acid change being evaluated needs to be compared to the impact of the established pathogenic change (e.g., a change of Ala to His is less severe than Ala to Cys). Consider reducing to SUPPORTING if the predicted impact is not expected to be equivalent or more severe. |
| **Supporting** | Can be considered at SUPPORTING if a different missense variant at the same codon has been classified as **likely pathogenic** using these modified guidelines **without application of PM5**. Consider reducing to NOT APPLICABLE if the predicted impact is not expected to be equivalent or more severe. |

**Important Notes:**
- PM5 should **NOT** be combined with PM1. If both are applicable at MODERATE weight, use of PM5 is most appropriate since it is variant specific.
- If both are applicable at SUPPORTING weight, PM5 is preferred. If one is at a higher strength than the other, the higher strength criterion should be applied.

**Modification Type:** General recommendation

---

### PM6 - De Novo (Assumed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:**

Refer to SVI guidance on number/combination of cases required based on phenotype specificity. For most cardiomyopathies, it is recommended to default to "phenotype consistent with gene but not highly specific". Clinical judgment is required for shifting to a higher or lower phenotypic consistency.

See [PS2](#ps2---de-novo-confirmed) for the source-supplied phenotype and family-history considerations. The external SVI numeric mapping is not distributed with this package.

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### PP1 - Co-segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease. Note: May be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data.

**VCEP Specifications:**

Due to the genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of inherited cardiomyopathies, segregation thresholds have been conservatively set as follows:

#### PP1 Segregation Thresholds (Default - Cardiomyopathies)

| Strength | Segregations Required | LOD Score |
|----------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Supporting** | >=3 segregations | 0.9 |
| **Moderate** | >=5 segregations | 1.5 |
| **Strong** | >=7 segregations | 2.1 |

#### PP1 Thresholds for Highly Specific Phenotype (per Jarvik & Browning 2016)

When the phenotype/presentation is highly specific (e.g., early-onset severe RCM in all affected individuals):

| Strength | Segregations Required | LOD Score |
|----------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Supporting** | >=3 segregations | 0.9 |
| **Moderate** | >=4 segregations | 1.2 |
| **Strong** | >=5 segregations | 1.5 |

#### Counting Segregations

- Only **genotype positive/phenotype positive** individuals are counted as segregations, which can include affected obligate carriers.
- Genotype positive/phenotype negative individuals are generally **less informative** for cardiomyopathy genes due to variable age at onset and reduced penetrance.
- Phenotypes should be **clinically confirmed**, whenever possible, and should not include individuals with a suspected diagnosis.

#### Important Considerations

1. Segregation of a variant within a single family or haplotype has the potential to represent linkage disequilibrium with another undetected variant. If linkage disequilibrium is a concern, consider downgrading strength.
2. Use of segregation criteria should be carefully evaluated if variant frequency meets criteria for BS1.
3. Caution is needed when counting segregations in presence of other possible disease-causing variants, as both variants may be contributing to the phenotype.
4. Caution is needed when distantly related (>=3rd degree) affected individuals are connected by unknown or unaffected relatives (raises possibility of multiple causes of disease).

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### PP2 - Missense in Constrained Gene

**Original ACMG Summary:** Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.

**VCEP Specification: *Not Applicable***

**Comments:** Application of this rule takes into consideration empirical data quantifying levels of rare missense variant enrichment in HCM referral cohorts compared to population-based cohorts (Walsh *et al.* 2019, PMID:30696458) rather than the missense constraint score in gnomAD. For TNNI3, there is evidence for regional enrichment of rare missense variants (see PM1 specifications).

---

### PP3 - Computational Evidence

**Original ACMG Summary:** Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.). Caveat: As many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion. PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.

**VCEP Specification (Supporting):**

- Meta-predictors, such as REVEL, are preferred over multiple individual predictors.
- Use of **REVEL** (Ioannidis *et al.* 2016) is recommended at thresholds of **>=0.70 for PP3**.
- Clinical judgment is needed if any individual algorithms or conservation data are contradictory to REVEL data.
- Positive predictive value for benign/no impact predictions is generally higher than for pathogenic/impact predictions.
- **SpliceAI** is recommended for evaluation of predicted splice impacts.

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### PP4 - Phenotype Specificity

**Original ACMG Summary:** Patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

**VCEP Specification: *Not Applicable***

**Comments:** Inherited cardiomyopathies have high locus heterogeneity as well as non-genetic etiologies.

---

### PP5 - Reputable Source

**Original ACMG Summary:** Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation.

**VCEP Specification: *Not Applicable***

This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee (PMID: 29543229).

---

## Benign Criteria

### BA1 - Allele Frequency >5%

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is above 5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

**VCEP Specification (Stand Alone):**

Allele frequency is **>=0.001** based on the **filtering allele frequency (FAF)** in **gnomAD** in the subpopulation with the highest frequency (popmax).

**Additional Specifications:**
- The values used to calculate the BA1 threshold were derived from studies in Northern European populations. These thresholds can be applied to any population where disease prevalence is considered comparable (1/300 or lower).
- The threshold is applicable when assessing variants in the context of autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy.
- gnomAD is the preferred database. If a subpopulation-specific FAF other than the popmax is needed, this value can be calculated using the AlleleFrequencyApp on the CardioDB website:
  1. Using the Inverse AF tab, enter the population size and the number of alleles identified and it will calculate the FAF.
  2. Set confidence to 0.95 (95%).
  3. If the FAF is >=0.001, this rule can be applied.
- The FAF by platform (e.g., exome vs. genome; v.2.1.1 vs. v.3.1.1) should be considered; the larger population is most likely to have the most accurate representation of "true" population allele frequency.
- Caution is needed when considering any population cohorts that are smaller than the smallest subpopulations within gnomAD v.2.1.1 (e.g., ~5000 individuals or ~10,000 alleles). In smaller cohorts, the observed allele frequency may less accurately reflect the true allele frequency.

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### BS1 - Frequency Greater Than Expected

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.

**VCEP Specification (Strong):**

Allele frequency is **>=0.0001** for *TNNI3* based on the **filtering allele frequency (FAF)** in **gnomAD** in the subpopulation with the highest frequency (popmax).

- Criterion BS1 may only be used as **standalone evidence** to classify a variant as Likely Benign **in the absence of conflicting data**. See SVI guidance (Tavtigian *et al.* 2018; Tavtigian *et al.* 2020).
- See BA1 for additional specifications that also apply to BS1.

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific, Gene-specific

---

### BS2 - Observed in Healthy Adult

**Original ACMG Summary:** Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.

**VCEP Specification: *Not Applicable***

**Comments:** Inherited cardiomyopathies generally display reduced penetrance, variable expressivity, and adult-onset.

---

### BS3 - Functional Studies (No Effect)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.

**VCEP Specifications:**

Evaluation of studies/assays is required prior to application of functional evidence at any strength. Refer to SVI guidance for functional evidence (Brnich *et al.* 2020). In the context of cardiomyopathy, very few functional assays currently meet criteria sufficient for application of this rule at a STRONG level.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | See PS3 specifications. |
| **Moderate** | See PS3 specifications. |
| **Supporting** | See PS3 specifications. |

> The source does not supply separate BS3 assay outcomes at these strengths; the parenthetical negative-assay interpretations formerly shown here were not in the distributed specification.

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### BS4 - Lack of Segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family. Caveat: The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.

**VCEP Specification (Strong):**

Any non-segregations should be carefully evaluated to rule out a phenocopy or the presence of a second disease-causing variant before considering it as conflicting or benign evidence.

Key considerations:
1. The presence of "phenocopies" (e.g., athlete's heart, hypertensive heart disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, diabetic cardiomyopathy) can mimic non-segregation among affected individuals.
2. Families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent 'non-segregation'.

Because of these possibilities, **multiple (>=2) non-segregations** that are highly unlikely to be phenocopies or due to alternate variants (e.g., those without a possible alternate cause) **are required to apply this rule**. A higher number of non-segregations is necessary for instances where alternative causes are possible (e.g., non-segregation in a sibling with childhood onset cardiomyopathy versus a grandparent with hypertension and HCM).

Careful consideration of the above points is required when using this data as conflicting evidence, especially when overall evidence supports likely pathogenic or pathogenic.

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### BP1-BP7 - Benign Supporting

| Criterion | Status | Comment |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **BP1** | *Not Applicable* | For the current genes where null variants are a known mechanism, pathogenic missense variants have also been reported. |
| **BP2** | Supporting | Other variants must be pathogenic as defined by these specifications. Testing of parents or other informative relatives is often required to determine cis/trans status. If a variant is seen in *trans* with another pathogenic variant in >=2 cases and the phenotype is not more severe, this rule may be applied. <1% of HCM cases have >1 P/LP variant (0.6%; Alfares *et al.* 2015). Cannot be applied when variant has only been observed in *cis* with a pathogenic variant. |
| **BP3** | *Not Applicable* | Not applicable to the current genes. |
| **BP4** | Supporting | Use of **REVEL** is recommended at thresholds of **<=0.40 for BP4**. Meta-predictors preferred over multiple individual predictors. Clinical judgment is needed if any individual algorithms or conservation data are contradictory to REVEL data. **SpliceAI** is recommended for evaluation of predicted splice impacts. |
| **BP5** | *Not Applicable* | Co-occurrence with an established P/LP variant for a non-cardiomyopathy related disease does not reduce the likelihood that a variant is independently disease-causing for cardiomyopathy. |
| **BP6** | *Not Applicable* | This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen SVI VCEP Review Committee (PMID: 29543229). |
| **BP7** | Supporting | Also applicable to **intronic variants outside the splice consensus sequence (-4 and +7 outward)** for which splicing prediction algorithms predict no impact to the splice consensus sequence NOR the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved. Rule can be combined with BP4 to make a variant likely benign per Richards *et al.* 2015. |

> **Source contradiction:** PVS1 says loss of function is not currently an established TNNI3 disease mechanism, while the source's BP1 comment says "the current genes" have null variants as a known mechanism. Both statements are retained without harmonization; BP1 remains N/A as printed.

### Appendix E: PS4 Example Scenarios

#### Variant A - General Example (Strong)

Variant A detected in 22/7,437 cases (clinical lab) and 13/9,162 cases (literature); gnomAD total frequency 1/241,182 alleles.

| Comparison | OR [95% CI] | Strength |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Clinical lab (22 in 7,437) vs gnomAD Total (1 in 120,591) | 358 [**48**-2,655] | STRONG |
| Literature (13 in 9,162) vs gnomAD Total (1 in 120,591) | 171 [**22**-1,310] | STRONG |

Both analyses have lower bound 95% CI >=20, therefore PS4 applied at **STRONG**.

#### Variant B - Selecting a Control Cohort (Moderate)

Variant B detected in 12/5,792 (clinical lab) and 15/7,873 (literature, predominantly European cohorts); gnomAD total 1/238,590 alleles, gnomAD European 1/123,730 alleles.

| Comparison | OR [95% CI] | Strength |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Clinical lab vs gnomAD Total | 248 [**32**-1,905] | STRONG |
| Literature vs gnomAD Total | 227 [**30**-1,724] | STRONG |
| Clinical lab vs gnomAD European | 128 [**17**-988] | MODERATE |
| Literature vs gnomAD European | 118 [**16**-894] | MODERATE |

Since this is predominantly a European variant, the gnomAD European comparison is more appropriate. PS4 applied at **MODERATE**.

#### Variant C - Comparing Cohorts (Strong or Moderate)

Variant C detected across multiple labs and literature; absent from gnomAD (AN ~232,380).

| Comparison | OR [95% CI] | Strength |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Clinical lab A (4 in 2,481) vs gnomAD Total | 422 [**23**-7,841] | STRONG |
| Clinical lab B (8 in 5,953) vs gnomAD Total | 332 [**19**-5,757] | MODERATE |
| Literature (6 in 5,154) vs gnomAD Total | 293 [**16**-5,208] | MODERATE |

Key considerations: variant absent from gnomAD, consistent phenotype (DCM) across multiple non-overlapping cohorts, enrichment in 3 cohorts (higher moderate to strong range). Acceptable to apply PS4 at **STRONG**, though **MODERATE** also appropriate for a more conservative approach.

## Document corrections

- **2026-08-09 source verification:** Checked every page of `ClinGen_ACMG_Specifications_TNNI3_v1.0.pdf` and `CM-VCEP PS4 Example Scenarios.pdf`, including every worked table.
- Restored the core DOI and source caveats. Removed an undistributed PS2/PM6 numeric matrix and its derived point-based applicability claims; the core only refers to external SVI guidance. Removed inferred BS3 assay outcomes and the inferred PM4 Supporting condition. The complete PS4 attachment remains transcribed; its Variant C narrative's `gnomAF` typo is a source typo.
- Source-supplied reference DOIs: `10.1038/gim.2015.30`, `10.1002/humu.23626`, `10.1186/s13073-019-0690-2`, `10.1038/gim.2016.90`, `10.1016/j.cjca.2017.01.017`, `10.1016/j.cjca.2017.04.003`, `10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.117.001968`, `10.1093/eurheartj/ehz317`, `10.1186/s13073-019-0616-z`, `10.1038/gim.2017.218`, `10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.04.003`, `10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.08.016`, `10.1016/j.cell.2018.12.015`, `10.1038/gim.2017.210`, `10.1002/humu.24088`, and `10.1038/gim.2014.205`.
