## Pathogenic Criteria

### PVS1 - Null Variant

**Original ACMG Summary:** Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical ±1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease.

**Caveats:**
- Beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g. GFAP, MYH7)
- Use caution interpreting LOF variants at the extreme 3' end of a gene
- Use caution with splice variants that are predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the protein intact
- Use caution in the presence of multiple transcripts

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

**Comments:** Not applicable. Loss of function is not an established disease mechanism for MAP2K2-associated RASopathy.

---

### PS1 - Same Amino Acid Change

**Original ACMG Summary:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.

**Example:** Val->Leu caused by either G>C or G>T in the same codon.

**Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change. Applicable for observed analogous residue positions in *MAP2K1* and *MAP2K2*. |

**Modification Type:** Analogous Gene

---

### PS2 - De Novo (Confirmed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history.

**Note:** Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, etc. can contribute to non-maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** Follow SVI recommendations for point-based scoring in conjunction with PM6 (see Reference 1) and phenotypic specifications: full points awarded with RASopathy phenotypes, reduced points applicable to cases with minimal phenotypic information (i.e. prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests such as WES).

#### PS2/PM6 Point System

| Phenotypic Consistency | Confirmed *de novo* (PS2) | Assumed *de novo* (PM6) |
|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Phenotype is consistent with a RASopathy* | 2 points | 1 point |
| Limited phenotypic information** | 1 point | 0.5 points |
| Phenotype not consistent with RASopathy | 0 points | 0 points |

*\*Exclusive of prenatal cases*

*\*\*Applicable to prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES). Phenotypes for prenatal cases include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, increased nuchal translucency, cystic hygroma, or hydrops.*

#### Evidence Strength Thresholds

The MAP2K2 PDF body gives exact point values without comparator symbols: PS2 Very Strong 4, Strong 2, and Moderate 1; PM6 Strong 2, Moderate 1, and Supporting 0.5. The supplied `PS2_PM6 Scoring.jpg` extends the shared scale to all four strengths for either criterion, including PS2_Supporting and PM6_VeryStrong. Comparator semantics for this shared ladder are not stated.

| Points | Strength Level |
|--------|----------------|
| 0.5 | Supporting (PS2_Supporting or PM6_Supporting) |
| 1.0 | Moderate (PS2_Moderate or PM6) |
| 2.0 | Strong (PS2 or PM6_Strong) |
| 4.0 | Very Strong (PS2_VeryStrong or PM6_VeryStrong) |

**Modification Type:** Strength

---

### PS3 - Functional Studies

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product.

**Note:** Functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well-established.

**VCEP Specifications:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product. Approved assays are available in the supplemental materials.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | Two or more different approved assays |
| **Supporting** | One approved assay |

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific, Gene-specific, Strength

#### Approved Assay Instances for MAP2K2

The workbook approves two MAP2K2 assays. Its `Cell survival assay (Example)` sheet is a generic template populated with dummy data and is **not** a MAP2K2 assay.

| Assay | PMIDs / DOIs | Material and readout | Validation / controls | Workbook strength |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| **MEK Activation Assay** | 20358587, 16439621, 18060073 / 10.1002/ajmg.a.33342; 10.1126/science.1124642; 10.1371/journal.pone.0001279 | HEK293 cells; semi-quantitative pMEK/MEK ratio basally and/or after stimulation; abnormal = constitutive/increased/prolonged phosphorylation | Biological and technical replication not met; WT and vector controls met. P/LP-labeled row: F57C - P, P128Q - P, Y130C - NA, (S222D);(S226D) trans. B/LB-labeled row: kinase-inactive K101M - NA | PS3_Supporting; BS3_NA |
| **ERK Activation Assay** | 20358587, 16439621, 18060073 / same three DOIs | HEK293 cells; semi-quantitative pERK/ERK ratio | Biological and technical replication not met; WT and vector controls met. P/LP-labeled row: F57C - P, P128Q - P, (S222D);(S226D) trans. B/LB-labeled row: kinase-inactive K101M - NA | PS3_Supporting; BS3_NA |

> **Workbook strength conflict — do not resolve silently:** The ERK abnormal-readout cell says intermediate phosphorylation responses can support Moderate evidence and says P128Q was assigned Strong because of extensive clinical association. The same column's proposed strength is `PS3_Supporting; BS3_NA`, and the PDF assigns Supporting to one approved assay and Moderate to two or more different approved assays. All statements are preserved without selecting one.

---

### PS4 - Prevalence in Affected

**Original ACMG Summary:** The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls.

**Note 1:** Relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR), as obtained from case-control studies, is >5.0 and the confidence interval around the estimate of RR or OR does not include 1.0.

**Note 2:** In instances of very rare variants where case-control studies may not reach statistical significance, the prior observation of the variant in multiple unrelated patients with the same phenotype, and its absence in controls, may be used as moderate level of evidence.

**VCEP Specifications:** Strength adjustment using point-based scoring for autosomal dominant cases with phenotypic specifications: full points awarded with RASopathy phenotypes, reduced points applicable to cases with minimal phenotypic information.

#### PS4 Point System

| Phenotypic Consistency | Points per Proband |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Individual well-phenotyped with features of a RASopathy | 1 point |
| Limited phenotypic information compatible with RASopathy* | 0.5 points |
| No clinical information or isolated clinical features | 0 points |
| Well-phenotyped but consistent with non-RASopathy disorder** | -1 point |

*\*Applicable to prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES). Phenotypes for prenatal cases include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, increased nuchal translucency, cystic hygroma, or hydrops.*

*\*\*Negative points for PS4 represent proband affected with a non-RASopathy congenital disorder rather than a healthy individual (BS2). This typically applies to probands tested by exome analysis with multiple other clinical features supporting a distinct syndromic disorder (e.g. CHARGE, CdLS).*

#### Evidence Strength Thresholds

| Total Points | Strength Level |
|--------------|----------------|
| ≥1.0 | Supporting (PS4_Supporting) |
| ≥3.0 | Moderate (PS4_Moderate) |
| ≥5.0 | Strong (PS4) |

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### PM1 - Mutational Hot Spot

**Original ACMG Summary:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation.

**VCEP Specifications:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation. PM1 and PM5 may be used in conjunction at moderate levels, however, PM1 may not be applied if PM5_Strong is applied to avoid overweighting.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | Applicable only at **AA 47-65** and **AA 128-138**. Not applicable to specific amino acid residues (see PM5). |

#### Critical Functional Domains for MAP2K2

| Source-defined range |
|----------------------|
| AA 47-65 |
| AA 128-138 |

**Modification Type:** Gene-specific

**Note:** PM1 and PM5 may be used in conjunction at moderate levels, however, PM1 may NOT be applied if PM5_Strong is applied to avoid overweighting.

---

### PM2 - Absent from Controls

**Original ACMG Summary:** Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

**Caveat:** Population data for indels may be poorly called by next generation sequencing.

**VCEP Specifications:** The variant must be absent from controls (gnomAD).

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Supporting** | The variant must be absent from controls (gnomAD) |

**Modification Type:** Strength

---

### PM3 - In Trans with Pathogenic

**Original ACMG Summary:** For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant.

**Note:** This requires testing of parents (or offspring) to determine phase.

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

**Comments:** Not applicable. MAP2K2-associated RASopathy follows autosomal dominant inheritance.

---

### PM4 - Protein Length Changes

**Original ACMG Summary:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

**VCEP Specifications:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | No known repetitive areas in gene. Use as described. |

**Modification Type:** General recommendation

---

### PM5 - Novel Missense at Same Residue

**Original ACMG Summary:** Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before.

**Example:** Arg156His is pathogenic; now you observe Arg156Cys.

**Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:** Applicable for observed analogous residue positions in *MAP2K1* and *MAP2K2*. PM1 and PM5 may be used in conjunction at moderate levels, however, PM1 may not be applied if PM5_Strong is applied to avoid overweighting.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | ≥2 different [likely] pathogenic “residues changes” at the same codon observed in ≥5 probands |
| **Moderate** | 1 [likely] pathogenic residue change at the same codon |

**Modification Type:** Analogous Gene, Disease-specific, Strength

**Note:** Analogous residue positions between MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 are documented in the supplemental materials.

> **Source wording:** “residues changes” is preserved from the PDF and appears to be a grammatical typo.

---

### PM6 - De Novo (Assumed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** Follow SVI recommendations for point-based scoring in conjunction with PS2 (see Reference 1) and phenotypic specifications: full points awarded with RASopathy phenotypes, reduced points applicable to cases with minimal phenotypic information.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | 2 Points |
| **Moderate** | 1 Point |
| **Supporting** | 0.5 Points |

**Modification Type:** Strength

See [PS2/PM6 Point System](#ps2pm6-point-system) above for detailed scoring.

The supplied scoring image additionally shows **PM6_VeryStrong at 4 points**. This strength is absent from the PM6 rows in the PDF body but present in the VCEP-distributed supplement.

---

### PP1 - Co-segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease.

**Note:** May be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data.

**VCEP Specifications:** Segregation in more than one family is recommended.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | ≥7 informative meioses |
| **Moderate** | ≥5 informative meioses |
| **Supporting** | ≥3 informative meioses |

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific, Strength

---

### PP2 - Missense in Constrained Gene

**Original ACMG Summary:** Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

**Comments:** Not applicable because missense z score is <3.09 in gnomAD.

---

### PP3 - Computational Evidence

**Original ACMG Summary:** Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.).

**Caveat:** As many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion. PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.

**VCEP Specifications:** For missense variants: REVEL ≥ 0.7. For splicing impact, predicted outcome must match disease mechanism.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Supporting** | For missense variants: REVEL ≥ 0.7. For splicing impact, predicted outcome must match disease mechanism. |

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### PP4 - Phenotype Specificity

**Original ACMG Summary:** Patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

**Comments:** Not applicable, see PS4. Phenotypic information is incorporated into PS4 scoring.

---

### PP5 - Reputable Source

**Original ACMG Summary:** Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation.

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee (PMID: 29543229).

---

## Benign Criteria

### BA1 - Allele Frequency >5%

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is above 5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

**VCEP Specifications:** gnomAD filtering allele frequency ≥0.05%.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Stand Alone** | gnomAD filtering allele frequency ≥0.05% (≥0.0005) |

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### BS1 - Frequency Greater Than Expected

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.

**VCEP Specifications:** gnomAD filtering allele frequency ≥0.025%.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | gnomAD filtering allele frequency ≥0.025% (≥0.00025) |

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### BS2 - Observed in Healthy Adult

**Original ACMG Summary:** Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.

**VCEP Specifications:** Strength adjustment using point-based scoring based on phenotypic specifications. Phenotypic specifications: based on healthy homozygote or heterozygote individuals, reduced points for apparently unaffected heterozygous individuals, applicable to parent or sibling samples during clinical family evaluations.

#### BS2 Point System

| Phenotypic Consistency | Points per Individual |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Healthy homozygous individual assessed for a RASopathy | -3 points |
| Healthy heterozygous individual assessed for a RASopathy | -1 point |
| No phenotypic information other than "unaffected" heterozygote* | -0.25 points |
| No clinical information or nonspecific clinical features | 0 points |

*\*Typically applicable to parental or sibling samples during clinical family evaluations.*

#### Evidence Strength Thresholds

> **Source contradiction — do not resolve silently:** The PDF body assigns **BS2 Strong at -4 points** and **BS2 Supporting at -1 point**, with no comparator symbols. The VCEP-distributed `BS2 Scoring.jpg` instead assigns **BS2 Strong at -3 points**, Supporting at -1, and says Moderate is unavailable. The image states exact values without operators.

| Total Points | Strength Level |
|--------------|----------------|
| -1 (operator not stated) | Supporting (BS2_Supporting) |
| N/A | Moderate (not applicable) |
| -3 (operator not stated) | Strong (BS2) |

**Modification Type:** Strength

---

### BS3 - Functional Studies (No Effect)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

**Comments:** Approved functional studies are available for each individual gene in the supplemental material. Additional functional studies can be submitted to the expert panel for approval.

---

### BS4 - Lack of Segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.

**Caveat:** The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e. cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.

**VCEP Specifications:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Requires only one informative meiosis |

**Modification Type:** General recommendation

---

### BP1-BP7 - Benign Supporting

| Criterion | Status | Specifications |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **BP1** | Applicable | Truncating, LOF variant in a gene for which primarily missense, GOF variants are known to cause disease. This rule has contraindications for use with RASopathies. Given the disease mechanism is gain-of-function for RASopathies, BP1 should be used for any truncating variant (nonsense, frameshift, affects canonical splice sites, initiation codon, entire gene or multi-exon deletion) in genes without established LOF correlation to disease. See supplemental material regarding dosage sensitivity. |
| **BP2** | Applicable (point-based) | Points are awarded for an alternative molecular cause of a RASopathy in the same gene (and/or in conjunction with BP5) and the phenotype is consistent with expected severity of the RASopathy. **Supporting:** ≥(-1) Point; **Moderate:** ≥(-2) Points; **Strong:** ≥(-4) Points |
| **BP3** | Not Applicable | No known benign repetitive areas in RASopathy genes. |
| **BP4** | Applicable | For missense variants: REVEL ≤0.3. For splicing variants: predicted outcome is negligible or does not match disease mechanism. |
| **BP5** | Applicable (point-based) | Points are awarded for an alternative molecular cause of a RASopathy in a different gene (and/or in conjunction with BP2) and the phenotype is consistent with expected severity of the RASopathy. Points are also awarded for phenotypes inconsistent with a RASopathy and fully explained by a different causative variant (e.g. WES testing). **Supporting:** ≥(-1) Point; **Moderate:** ≥(-2) Points; **Strong:** ≥(-4) Points |
| **BP6** | Not Applicable | This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee (PMID: 29543229). |
| **BP7** | Applicable | A synonymous (silent) variant for which splicing prediction algorithms predict no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved. This rule is also applicable for intronic positions (except canonical splice sites) or non-coding variants and should be used in conjunction with BP4. |

> **Missing distributed content:** BP1 cites supplemental dosage-sensitivity information, but the MAP2K2 package contains no dosage-sensitivity file. The analogous-residue workbook, functional workbook, and four scoring images do not supply it.

#### BP5/BP2 Point System

| Phenotypic Consistency | Points per Individual |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Phenotype inconsistent with a RASopathy and causative variant has been identified, **-or-** Molecular cause of a RASopathy is identified in a different RASopathy gene, **-or-** Molecular cause of a RASopathy is identified in *trans* or *cis* with the variant being classified | -1 point |
| Phenotype inconsistent with a RASopathy and no causative variant identified/reported | 0 points |

#### BP5/BP2 Evidence Strength Thresholds

> **Source contradiction — do not resolve silently:** The PDF body assigns Strong at **≥(-4)**, Moderate at **≥(-2)**, and Supporting at **≥(-1)** for both BP2 and BP5. The VCEP-distributed `BP5_BP2 Scoring.jpg` instead assigns Strong at **-3**, says Moderate is **N/A**, and assigns Supporting at **-1**. The image states exact values without comparator symbols.

| Total Points | Strength Level |
|--------------|----------------|
| -1 (operator not stated) | Supporting (BP5/BP2) |
| N/A | Moderate (not applicable) |
| -3 (operator not stated) | Strong (BP5_Strong/BP2_Strong) |

| MAP2K2 | AA 47-65 | PM1_Moderate |
| MAP2K2 | AA 128-138 | PM1_Moderate |

### Appendix D: Analogous Residues

MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 share analogous residue positions that can be used for PS1 and PM5 application. Refer to the supplemental Analogous Residues file for the complete alignment.

| Gene | Protein Accession |
|------|-------------------|
| MAP2K1 | NP_002746.1 |
| MAP2K2 | NP_109587.1 |

> **Supplement structure:** The relevant workbook sheet supplies these accessions and two embedded image alignments, not a discrete residue-lookup table. Two additional sheets named `SOS variants from HGMD` and `SOS variants case counts` are unrelated copied SOS1/SOS2 working data and are not MAP2K evidence.

### Appendix E: Reference PMIDs

## Version History

| Version | Date | Notes |

| 2.3.0 | 12/3/2024 | Submitting Pilot Rules. All pilot variants attached in LZTR1 submission. "Observed in ≥5 probands" removed from PM5 at Moderate strength. |

**Document corrections (2026-08-07), source-verified against `ClinGen_ACMG_Specifications_MAP2K2_v2.3.pdf`, `Analogous Residues.xlsx`, `Approved Functional Studies.xlsx`, `PS2_PM6 Scoring.jpg`, `PS4 Scoring.jpg`, `BP5_BP2 Scoring.jpg`, and `BS2 Scoring.jpg`. No change to the underlying ClinGen specification version.**

- **Fabricated assay removed:** the generic `Cell survival assay (Example)` worksheet, populated with dummy Jones/1985/PMID 1234567 data, had been presented as an approved MAP2K2 assay. The workbook approves only MEK and ERK activation for MAP2K2.
- **Functional evidence re-transcribed:** both approved assays now carry their actual PMIDs, DOIs, materials, replication failures, controls, validation statuses, and strengths. The ERK column's claim that intermediate results can be Moderate and P128Q was selected at Strong is reported alongside—without reconciliation—the same column's `PS3_Supporting` designation and the PDF's assay-count framework.
- **Scoring contradictions restored:** BS2 is -4 in the PDF body versus -3 in its image; BP2/BP5 use PDF tiers ≥(-4)/≥(-2)/≥(-1) versus image tiers -3/N/A/-1. Invented `≤` comparators were removed from image-derived tables.
- **PM1 invention removed:** the source provides only AA 47-65 and AA 128-138; “Critical Domain 1/2” and “kinase domain region 1/2” labels were not source terms and have been removed.
- **Supplement provenance qualified:** the analogous workbook contains two MAP2K alignment images plus unrelated copied SOS working sheets, not a discrete residue map. Only the relevant alignment is represented.
- **Supplement-only strengths and source wording identified:** the scoring image adds PS2_Supporting and PM6_VeryStrong to criterion blocks that omit them; the PDF's “residues changes” typo is preserved and flagged.
- **Missing BP1 content recorded:** no dosage-sensitivity supplement is distributed for MAP2K2.
