## General Comments

In addition to the specific criteria for codes listed below, the VCEP has adopted the **point-based combining scoring** in Table 2 and Table 3 of PMID: 32720330 (Tavtigian et al., 2020). Table 2 assigns points for pathogenic (0 for indeterminate, 1 for supporting, 2 for moderate, 4 for strong, and 8 for very strong), and benign (0 for indeterminate, -1 for supporting, -2 for moderate, -4 for strong, and -8 for very strong) codes. Table 3 provides final categories of **Pathogenic (>=10)**, **Likely Pathogenic (6-9)**, **Uncertain (0-5)**, **Likely Benign (-1 to -6)**, **Benign (<=-7)**. This replaces the combining rules listed below.

### Phenotype Requirement for Pathogenic Phenotype Codes

> **Note:** Probands being considered for any pathogenic phenotype codes (e.g. PP1, PP4, PM6, PS2, PS4) at any strength must have the following phenotype characteristics:
> - Affected males should have some functional vision impairment by age 13
> - With either observed foveo-macular changes or ERG measurement of a subnormal B wave

## Pathogenic Criteria

### PVS1 - Null Variant

**Original ACMG Summary:** Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical +/-1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease.

**Caveats:**
- Beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g. GFAP, MYH7).
- Use caution interpreting LOF variants at the extreme 3' end of a gene.
- Use caution with splice variants that are predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the protein intact.
- Use caution in the presence of multiple transcripts.

**VCEP Specifications:** Use the attached RS1-specific PVS1 Decision Tree file, which has been modified from Abou Tayoun et al., 2018 (PMID 30192042) and incorporates splice site guidance from Walker et al., 2023 (PMID 37352859). Refer to the RS1-specific PVS1 Decision Tree document for complete information.

The structure of RS1 is important for function. The RS1 monomers have cystine disulfide bonds within a RS1 monomer and bonds with the two neighboring monomers to form an octomer substructure and bonds to the second RS1 octomer that completes the paired octomer structure. Within this structure there are a number of sites that have been shown to function in other types of protein structure stabilization.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Very Strong** | Applies to nonsense, frameshift, splice site, and deletion variants in NM_000330.4 c.1A to c.671C (p.Met1 to p.Cys223) and to duplications in NM_000330.4 c.1 to c.472 (p.Met1 to p.Asp158). |
| **Strong** | Applies to frameshift variants, GT--AG splice variants, deletions, duplications or nonsense variants in NM_000330.4 c.672 to c.677 (p.Asp224 to p.*225). |
| **Moderate** | Use RS1-specific PVS1 Decision Tree file as per Abou Tayoun et al. and Walker et al. guidance. |

**Modification Type:** Gene-specific

#### PVS1 Decision Tree Summary

**Nonsense or Frameshift:**

| Region | NMD Predicted? | PVS1 Strength |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| NM_000330.4:c.1-472 | Yes | PVS1 |
| NM_000330.4:c.473-671 (up to p.Cys223) | No, but impacts critical structure/function | PVS1 |
| NM_000330.4:c.672-677 | No, function of region unknown, LoF not frequent in general population | PVS1_Strong |

**GT--AG +/-1,2 Splice Sites:**

| Scenario | PVS1 Strength |
|----------|---------------|
| Skipping exons 1-3 (c.1-184), disrupts reading frame, predicted NMD | PVS1 |
| Exon skipping in c.473-671, impacts regions critical to protein structure up through p.Cys223 | PVS1 |
| c.672-677 changes, function of region unknown | PVS1_Strong |

**Note:** Splice site variants at +/-1,2 positions should NOT be applied in combination with in silico splicing predictions (PP3). Splice site variants must have no detectable nearby (+/-20nts) strong consensus splice sequence that may constitute in-frame splicing.

**Deletion (single exon to full gene):**

| Scenario | PVS1 Strength |
|----------|---------------|
| Full gene deletion in a male | PVS1 (Pathogenic warranted) |
| Single to multi exon deletion disrupting reading frame, predicted NMD | PVS1 |
| Exons 1-3 (c.1-184), single exon deletions disrupt reading frame | PVS1 |
| c.672-677 deletions, function of region unknown | PVS1_Strong |
| Exon 4-6 single exon or multi exon deletions preserving reading frame, up to p.Cys223 (c.1-671) impacting critical protein structure | PVS1 |

**Duplication (>=1 exon, completely contained within gene):**

| Scenario | PVS1 Strength |
|----------|---------------|
| Proven/presumed in tandem, c.1-472, predicted NMD | PVS1 |
| c.473-671, impacts critical protein structure | PVS1 |
| c.672-677, function of region unknown | PVS1_Strong |

**Initiation Codon:**

| Scenario | PVS1 Strength |
|----------|---------------|
| p.Met1 (c.1-3) is the only known start codon; >=1 pathogenic variant(s) upstream of the closest potential in-frame start codon at c.441-443 (p.Met147) | PVS1 |

#### NMD Prediction Boundary

NMD prediction based on the premature termination codon not occurring in the 3' most exon or in the 3' most 50bp of the penultimate exon: **p.Ser2 to p.Asp158** in transcript NM_000330.4:c.4-472.

#### Key Transcript Positions

| Feature | Position | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Start codon | c.1-3 (p.1) | |
| Nearest in-frame start codon | c.441-443 (p.147) | In exon 5 |
| Next nearest in-frame start codon | c.639-641 (p.213) | In exon 6 |
| Stop codon | c.675-677 (p.225) | |
| NMD predicted cutoff | c.472 | |
| Stop codon after stop-loss | c.*127 | Adds 43 amino acids |

#### RS1 Exon Map (NM_000330.4)

| Exon | Acceptor Start | Donor End | HG38 Start | HG38 End | FS/In-frame | NMD? | PVS1 Code | Critical? | Domain |
|------|---------------|-----------|------------|----------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | c.-40 | c.52 | 18,672,108 | 18,672,017 | FS | NMD | PVS1 (B) | Yes | Leader sequence |
| 2 | c.53 | c.78 | 18,657,665 | 18,657,640 | FS | NMD | PVS1 (C) | Yes | Leader sequence |
| 3 | c.79 | c.184 | 18,656,758 | 18,656,653 | FS | NMD | PVS1 (C) | Yes | RS1 domain |
| 4 | c.185 | c.326 | 18,647,332 | 18,647,191 | In-frame | NMD | PVS1 (F) | Yes | Discoidin domain |
| 5 | c.327 | c.522 | 18,644,625 | 18,644,430 | In-frame | No NMD | PVS1 (F) | Yes | Discoidin domain |
| 6 | c.523 | c.*2316 | 18,642,156 | 18,639,688 | In-frame | No NMD | PVS1 (F) | Yes | Discoidin domain |

**Note:** All exons 1-6 are considered "critical to protein function" based on pathogenic missense variants identified in all exons. The requirement for being more than 10% of total protein length does not apply. No potential "rescue isoforms" are known.

---

### PS1 - Same Amino Acid Change

**Original ACMG Summary:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.

**Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:** Refer to the RS1-specific PVS1 Decision Tree document for complete information.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Same amino acid change as a previously established **Pathogenic** variant. Comparison variant must have been evaluated by the X-linked IRD VCEP using these rules and established as Pathogenic. For assessing same amino acid changes, SpliceAI scores for both variants should be within 10% of each other. |
| **Moderate** | Same amino acid change as a previously established **(Likely) Pathogenic** variant. Comparison variant must have been evaluated by the X-linked IRD VCEP and established as Likely Pathogenic. SpliceAI scores for both variants should be within 10% of each other. |
| **Supporting** | Same amino acid change as a previously established **(Likely) Pathogenic** variant evaluated by the X-linked IRD VCEP and established as Likely Pathogenic. SpliceAI scores for both variants should be within 10% of each other. |

**Modification Type:** Clarification, General recommendation

#### PS1 Splicing Evaluation Rules

**When evaluating splicing impact with a previously classified Pathogenic variant (PS1 Strong):**
- Use in conjunction with PP3 for variants located **outside** the splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 dinucleotide positions that have SpliceAI score >=0.2 and have a comparable nucleotide variant at the same position designated Pathogenic.
- Use in conjunction with PVS1 for variants located **at** the splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 dinucleotide positions that have a comparable variant within the same splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 dinucleotide designated Pathogenic.

**When evaluating splicing impact with a previously classified Likely Pathogenic or Pathogenic variant (PS1 Moderate):**
- Use with PP3 for variants outside +/-1,2 positions with SpliceAI >=0.2 and comparable LP variant at same position.
- Use with PP3 for variants outside +/-1,2 positions with SpliceAI >=0.2 and comparable P variant within same splice region with same predicted impact.
- Use with PVS1 at any strength for variants at +/-1,2 positions with SpliceAI >=0.2 and comparable P variant within same splice motif region but outside +/-1,2 positions with same predicted impact.

**When evaluating splicing impact with a previously classified Likely Pathogenic variant (PS1 Supporting):**
- Use with PP3 for variants outside +/-1,2 positions with SpliceAI >=0.2 and comparable LP variant within same splice motif region but outside +/-1,2 positions with same predicted impact.
- Use with PVS1 for variants at +/-1,2 positions with SpliceAI >=0.2 and comparable P variant at same +/-1,2 position with same predicted impact.
- Use with PVS1 for variants at +/-1,2 positions with comparable LP or P variant within same splice motif region but outside +/-1,2 positions with same predicted impact.
- Use with PVS1 at any strength for variants at +/-1,2 positions with comparable LP variant within same splice motif region but outside +/-1,2 positions with same predicted impact.

#### PS1 Code Weights for Splice Variants (Table 2 from Walker et al., 2023)

| Variant Under Assessment | Baseline Code | Position of Comparison Variant | PS1 with P Comparison | PS1 with LP Comparison |
|--------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Outside splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 | PP3 | Same nucleotide | PS1 | PS1_Moderate |
| Outside splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 | PP3 | Within same splice donor/acceptor motif (incl. +/-1,2) | PS1_Moderate | PS1_Supporting |
| At splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 | PVS1 | Within same +/-1,2 dinucleotide | PS1_Supporting | N/A |
| At splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 | PVS1 | Within same splice region, outside +/-1,2 | PS1_Supporting | PS1_Supporting |
| At splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 | PVS1_Strong/Moderate/Supporting | Within same +/-1,2 dinucleotide | PS1 | N/A |
| At splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 | PVS1_Strong/Moderate/Supporting | Within same splice motif, outside +/-1,2 | PS1_Moderate | PS1_Supporting |

### PS2 - De Novo (Confirmed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history.

**Note:** Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, etc. can contribute to non-maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** Use SVI point scale for counting cases (see PS2/PM6 Tables). Use option 1 "Phenotype highly specific for gene" when OCT (optical coherence tomography) data showing schisis is available.

#### PS2/PM6 Point System (Table 1)

| Phenotypic Consistency | Confirmed de novo with confirmed maternity | Assumed de novo with assumed maternity |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Phenotype highly specific for gene** - Requires OCT showing schisis | 2.0 points per proband | 1.0 points per proband |
| **Phenotype consistent with gene but not highly specific** - Use when lacking OCT data | 1.0 points per proband | 0.5 points per proband |

#### PS2/PM6 Evidence Strength Thresholds (Table 2)

| Total Points | Strength Level |
|--------------|----------------|
| 0.5 | Supporting |
| 1.0 | Moderate |
| 2.0 | Strong |
| 4.0 | Very Strong |

**Modification Type:** Gene-specific

---

### PS3 - Functional Studies

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product.

**Note:** Functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well-established.

**VCEP Specifications:** See RS1 Functional Assay sheet.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Variants tested in high quality knock-out/knock-in variant mouse lines can meet PS3 at the strong level. |
| **Supporting** | Use at the supporting strength for most assays (see Functional Assays Table). |

**VCEP Specifications:**

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Applies to variants in amino acids **p.Cys40, p.Cys59, p.Cys63, p.Cys110, p.Cys142, p.Cys219, and p.Cys223** which form disulfide bridges required for structure of the retinoschisin monomer, dimers, or octamers. |
| **Moderate** | Applies to amino acids **p.Glu72, p.Trp122, p.Trp163, p.Arg200, p.Glu215** which form salt bridges that are required for higher order structure of octamers and paired octamers. |

**Modification Type:** Gene-specific

---

### PM2 - Absent from Controls

**Original ACMG Summary:** Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in population databases.

**Caveat:** Population data for indels may be poorly called by next generation sequencing.

**VCEP Specification (Supporting only):**
- At low frequency in **males** in population databases
- Use **<2.0x10^-6** for cutoff
- This is defined relative to the BA1 cutoff

**Modification Type:** Clarification, Gene-specific

---

### PM3 - In Trans with Pathogenic

**Original ACMG Summary:** For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant.

**VCEP Specifications:** **Not Applicable** - RS1 is an X-linked gene; this criterion does not apply.

---

### PM4 - Protein Length Changes

**Original ACMG Summary:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

**VCEP Specifications:** Use SVI specification.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | In-frame deletion/insertions smaller than one whole exon, in a non-repetitive region, or stop-loss variants. Variant must not be considered in any PVS1 criteria. Variant must also meet PM2. |

**Modification Type:** General recommendation, Gene-specific

---

### PM5 - Novel Missense at Same Residue

**Original ACMG Summary:** Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before.

**Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | Same residue as a previously established **pathogenic** variant classified using these specifications (assessed independently of PM5). The novel change must not affect splicing (SpliceAI <=0.2), must meet PP3, and have a Grantham score equal or greater than the previously published variants. |
| **Supporting** | Same residue as a previously established **likely pathogenic** variant classified using these specifications (assessed independently of PM5). The novel change must not affect splicing (SpliceAI <=0.2), must meet PP3, and have a Grantham score equal or greater than the previously published variants. |

**Modification Type:** Clarification, Gene-specific

---

### PM6 - De Novo (Assumed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** **Not Applicable** - See PS2 for de novo data. De novo evidence (both confirmed and assumed) is handled through the PS2/PM6 point system described under PS2.

---

### PP1 - Co-segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease.

**Note:** May be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data.

**VCEP Specifications:** Probands must meet phenotype requirements. Only phenotype positive **male** relatives with the same variant identified in the proband should be counted as segregations.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | >=3 meioses in 1 or 2 families |
| **Moderate** | 2 meioses in a family (e.g. 2 brothers and mother genotyped; 3 brothers without mother's genotype; or uncle and nephew) |
| **Supporting** | 1 meiosis in a family |

**Modification Type:** Gene-specific, Strength

---

### PP2 - Missense in Constrained Gene

**Original ACMG Summary:** Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.

**VCEP Specifications:** **Not Applicable**

**Comments:** Loss of function variants are underrepresented. The Z score in gnomAD is 0.97. The pLoF eligible alleles for this code is 0/303.

---

### PP3 - Computational Evidence

**Original ACMG Summary:** Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.).

**Caveat:** As many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion. PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.

**VCEP Specifications:** Use the SpliceAI flowchart included in the RS1-specific PVS1 Decision Tree file.

#### For Missense Variants (REVEL-based)

| Strength | REVEL Score | Additional Requirements |
|----------|------------|------------------------|
| **Strong** | >0.931 | SpliceAI <0.2 (not predicted to disrupt splicing) |
| **Moderate** | 0.773 - 0.931 | SpliceAI <0.2 (not predicted to disrupt splicing) |
| **Supporting** | 0.644 - 0.772 | SpliceAI <0.2 (not predicted to disrupt splicing) |

#### For Splicing Predictions (SpliceAI-based)

| SpliceAI Delta Score | Code Applied |
|---------------------|-------------|
| >=0.2 | PP3 applied (then see PS1 splice variant rules for comparison variants) |
| >0.1 and <0.2 | PP3 N/A for splicing; consider missense/indel predictions for exonic variants |
| <=0.1 | BP4 applied (see BP4 section) |

**Modification Type:** General recommendation

#### SpliceAI Flowchart Notes

For variants located outside of donor/acceptor +/-1,2 dinucleotide positions:
- SpliceAI delta score >=0.2: **PP3** applied; see RS1-specific PVS1 (RNA) Decision Tree for PS1 combinations
- SpliceAI delta score >0.1 and <0.2: **PP3 N/A** (splicing); consider missense/indel predictions for exonic variants
- SpliceAI delta score <=0.1: **BP4** applied

**Donor and acceptor splice region positions excluded from BP7:**
- Synonymous substitutions in the first base of an exon
- Synonymous substitutions in the last three bases of an exon
- +1 through +7 of the donor sequence after an exon
- -1 through -21 of the acceptor sequence before an exon

---

### PP4 - Phenotype Specificity

**Original ACMG Summary:** Patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

**VCEP Specifications:** Probands must meet phenotype requirements: affected males should have some functional vision impairment by age 13, with a diagnosis of Retinoschisis and an image of schisis.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | A male proband diagnosed with retinoschisis by the age of 13 with visual acuity impairment, showing schisis, **and** having retinal detachment. |
| **Supporting** | A male proband diagnosed with retinoschisis by the age of 13 with visual acuity impairment **and** showing schisis. |

**Modification Type:** Clarification, Gene-specific, Strength

---

### PP5 - Reputable Source

**Original ACMG Summary:** Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation.

**VCEP Specifications:** **Not Applicable** - This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee (PMID: 29543229).

---

## Benign Criteria

### BA1 - Allele Frequency >5%

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is above 5% in population databases.

**VCEP Specifications:** Any variant meeting both BA1 and PP3 must be reviewed by the VCEP.

**VCEP Specification (Stand Alone):**
- Allele frequency **>=2x10^-4** in **males** in population databases (Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes, or Exome Aggregation Consortium) in the subpopulation with the highest frequency.

**Modification Type:** Clarification

---

### BS1 - Frequency Greater Than Expected

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.

**VCEP Specifications:** Variants meeting both BS1 and PP3 must be reviewed by the VCEP.

**VCEP Specification (Strong):**
- Allele frequency **>=2x10^-5** in **males** in population databases
- The highest allele frequency in population databases should be used

**Modification Type:** Gene-specific

---

### BS2 - Observed in Healthy Adult

**Original ACMG Summary:** Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.

**VCEP Specification (Strong):**
- Only count **males over age 30** with a documented eye exam without retinoschisis
- BS2_Strong for variants observed in **at least 3 unaffected males**

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific, Gene-specific

---

### BS3 - Functional Studies (No Effect)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.

**VCEP Specifications:** **Not Applicable**

**Comments:** The many secretion assays have not tested enough benign variants to meet the threshold in PMID 31892348 Supplemental Table 1 or Supplemental Table 2.

---

### BS4 - Lack of Segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.

**Caveat:** The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e. cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.

**VCEP Specification (Supporting):**
- Paternal inheritance is inconsistent with this gene
- For RS1, unaffected males over age 10 who have been examined could be used to establish this code if they have no schisis and good acuity

**Modification Type:** Gene-specific

---

### BP1-BP7 - Benign Supporting

| Criterion | Status | Comment |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **BP1** | Not Applicable | Missense variant in a gene for which primarily truncating variants are known to cause disease. |
| **BP2** | Not Applicable | For this X-linked gene, only variants in cis with a pathogenic variant in RS1 in an affected male could be used, but these variants could have combined effect. The VCEP does not use this code. |
| **BP3** | Not Applicable | In-frame deletions/insertions in a repetitive region without a known function. |
| **BP4** | See below | Multiple lines of computational evidence suggest no impact on gene or gene product. |
| **BP5** | Not Applicable | Variant found in a case with an alternate molecular basis for disease. |
| **BP6** | Not Applicable | This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen SVI VCEP Review Committee (PMID: 29543229). |
| **BP7** | See below | Synonymous variant with no predicted splicing impact and low conservation. |

#### BP4 - Computational Evidence (Benign)

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Stand Alone** | Missense variants: REVEL <=0.003 with SpliceAI <=0.1 |
| **Strong** | Missense variants: REVEL between 0.004 and 0.016 with SpliceAI <=0.1 |
| **Moderate** | Missense variants: REVEL between 0.017 and 0.183 with SpliceAI <=0.1 |
| **Supporting** | Missense variants: REVEL between 0.184 and 0.290 with SpliceAI <=0.1 **OR** Synonymous variants or noncoding variants: SpliceAI <=0.1 |

**Modification Type:** General recommendation

#### BP7 - Synonymous Variant

**VCEP Specifications:** This code may be used with BP4 as described in the RS1-specific PVS1 Decision Tree file splicing document and Walker et al., 2023.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Applies to splicing assay data demonstrating a variant is NOT associated with aberrantly spliced transcript(s) relative to transcript profiles in controls. See RS1 PVS1 Decision Tree. As per Walker et al., 2023 (PMID 37352859) guidance. |
| **Supporting** | Synonymous variants or noncoding variants with no impact on splicing (SpliceAI <=0.1) **AND** PhyloP <0.1 for conservation. |

**Modification Type:** Clarification, Gene-specific

- **(C)** Exon skipping or use of a cryptic splice motif disrupts reading frame and is predicted to undergo NMD.
- **(D)** Exon skipping or use of a cryptic splice motif preserves reading frame, and removes a region (>10% of the protein) which has not been established as critical to protein function.
- **(E)** Exon skipping or use of a cryptic splice motif disrupts reading frame and is predicted to undergo NMD.
- **(F)** Exon skipping or use of a cryptic splice motif preserves reading frame, and removes a region which has been established as critical to protein function.
- **(G)** Exon skipping or use of a cryptic splice motif preserves reading frame, and removes a region (<10% of the protein) which has not been established as critical to protein function.
- **(H)** Exon skipping or use of a cryptic splice motif disrupts reading frame and is not predicted to undergo NMD, and removes a region (<10% of the protein) which has not been established as critical to protein function.
- **(I)** Exon skipping or use of a cryptic splice motif disrupts reading frame and is not predicted to undergo NMD, and removes a region (<10% of the protein) which has not been established as critical to protein function.

## Document corrections (2026-08-17)

- Re-checked the complete four-file package source-first, including every assay-workbook sheet and the image-based PVS1/PVS1(RNA) and de novo tables.
- Preserved the RS1-specific exon map, NMD boundary, splice/RNA routes, and the separate handling of experiments that still produce protein.
- Verified the exact 0.5/1/2/4 de novo totals and both phenotype-consistency rows without adding range operators.
- Re-transcribed approved and non-approved assay instances, keeping workbook approval status and proposed strength separate from the mere presence of a publication.
