## Important Phenotype Requirements

> [!WARNING]
> **Unresolved source inconsistency:** For PS4, PP1, and PP4, the source says the phenotype must include diabetes “without clear evidence of an autoimmune etiology,” then immediately prints the following bullets without a connector. The bullets themselves describe positive autoantibodies and very low or negative C-peptide. This document preserves that source content and does not infer whether the bullets are inclusion or exclusion conditions.

For multiple criteria (PS4, PP1, PP4), the source prints: “Phenotype of affected individuals must include diabetes, without clear evidence of an autoimmune etiology:” followed by:

- One or more positive diabetes autoantibodies (IA-2A, ZnT8A+, GAD)
- Very low or negative C-peptide, defined as:
  - Fasting or non-fasting random C-peptide `<200pmol/L or 0.6ng/mL`
  - Urinary C-peptide/creatinine ratio <0.2 nmol/mmol

---

## Pathogenic Criteria

### PVS1 - Null Variant

**Original ACMG Summary:** Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical ±1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease.

**Caveats:**
- Beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g., GFAP, MYH7)
- Use caution interpreting LOF variants at the extreme 3' end of a gene
- Use caution with splice variants that are predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the protein intact
- Use caution in the presence of multiple transcripts

**VCEP Specifications:** Use HNF1A PVS1 decision tree. Per recommendations from the SVI, when RNA analysis demonstrates abnormal splicing from non-canonical splice site variants, apply PS3 instead of PVS1.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Very Strong (PVS1)** | See detailed specifications below |
| **Strong (PVS1_Strong)** | See detailed specifications below |
| **Supporting (PVS1_Supporting)** | See detailed specifications below |

#### PVS1 - Very Strong

Apply PVS1 to:

1. **Nonsense or frameshift variants occurring 5' of c.1768**
   - Variants generating PTCs 3' of c.1714 of NM_000545.8 (which includes the last 55 nucleotides of exon 9 and all of exon 10) are not expected to cause NMD
   - The transactivation domain (TAD) of the protein overlaps with this region
   - The last 55 nucleotides of exon 9 (c.1714-1768) is enriched for disease-causing variants and loss-of-function variants in this region have been found in patients/families with a MODY phenotype
   - Therefore, "very strong" level of evidence will be used for loss-of-function variants 5' of c.1768 regardless of where the premature termination codon occurs

2. **Exon skipping or use of a cryptic splice site that preserves reading frame AND Single to multi-exon deletion that preserves reading frame**
   - Apply PVS1 for exon skipping or single to multi exon deletion involving **exons 1-9**
   - Deletions of exon 1 would lead at least to loss of the initiation codon
   - Deletions of single exons 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 or 9 all cause frameshift, and thus PVS1 would be used
   - In HNF1A, only exon 7 (LRG_522t1) is surrounded by introns of the same phase. Skipping or deletion of exon 7 would remove 64 amino acids in the TAD, which is >10% of the protein and 18% of the TAD. Given the significance of the TAD, PVS1 is still used instead of PVS1_Strong

3. **Initiation codon variants**
   - Apply PVS1 to initiation codon variants
   - Four initiation codon variants have been identified in patients with a MODY phenotype
   - The closest potential in-frame start codon is p.Met118
   - Starting the protein at p.Met118 would remove 18% of the protein, including the entire dimerization domain
   - There are many P/LP variants upstream of p.Met118

#### PVS1_Strong

Apply PVS1_Strong to:

1. **Nonsense variants at c.1803 (p.601) and 5'** AND **frameshift variants at c.1854 (p.618) and 5'**
   - The distinction of nonsense and frameshift variants was made following a careful review of the phenotypes of individuals with loss-of-function variants in exon 10
   - The addition of new amino acids from a frameshift will disrupt the TAD and cause a MODY phenotype more so than the deletion of a small part of the end of the TAD
   - Moderate phenotypic evidence was applied to the c.1802del (p.601Ter) variant, but the individual with the next nonsense variant (p.Gln625Ter) was unaffected
   - Frameshift variants at p.Ile618 and 5' have been identified in patients with a phenotype consistent with MODY

2. **Deletions of exon 10 and splicing variants that would predict the skipping of exon 10**
   - A deletion of exon 10 would remove part of the TAD but less than 10% of the protein
   - Since the TAD is critical to protein function, and variants that disrupt all of exon 10 have been found in patients with a MODY phenotype, preserve the source's malformed wording: “we will use This [sic] specification is in accordance with Tayoun's recommendation to use PVS1_Strong in cases in which the truncated region is critical to protein function.”

#### PVS1_Supporting

Apply PVS1_Supporting to:
- Nonsense variants occurring **3' of c.1803 (p.601)**
- Frameshift variants occurring **3' of c.1854 (p.618)**
- Limited evidence of patients with MODY phenotype at this time

---

### PS1 - Same Amino Acid Change

**Original ACMG Summary:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.

**Example:** Val->Leu caused by either G>C or G>T in the same codon.

**Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Applicable for a same amino acid change if the previously established variant is classified as **pathogenic** by ClinGen MDEP specifications |
| **Moderate** | Applicable for a same amino acid change if the previously established variant is classified as **likely pathogenic** by ClinGen MDEP specifications |
| **Supporting** | See splicing variant specifications below |

**For splicing variants:** PS1 can be applied for canonical and `non-canoncial` [sic] splicing variants that have a SpliceAI score within 10% of the original variant, or a greater predicted deleterious impact than the `comparision` [sic] (likely) pathogenic variant. See Table 2 from PMID: 37352859 for determining when PS1 should be applied at the Strong, Moderate, or Supporting level in these instances.

---

### PS2 - De Novo (Confirmed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history.

**Note:** Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, etc. can contribute to non-maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:**
- Use SVI recommended point-based system with MDEP specifications for "Phenotype Consistency"
- **Do not apply PS2** if the proband has an affected parent with any of the following:
  - Affected parent meets PP4 specifications
  - Parent is described as having similarly atypical diabetes to the proband
  - Parent was diagnosed with non-autoimmune diabetes before age 30

#### PS2/PM6 Point System

**Table 1. Points\* awarded per de novo occurrence**

| Phenotypic consistency | *de novo* with confirmed parental relationships | *de novo* with unconfirmed parental relationships |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Phenotype highly specific for gene | 2 | 1 |
| Phenotype consistent with gene but not highly specific | 1 | 0.5 |

\*Note that these points are *not equivalent* to the points used to classify a variant per the Tavtigian et al 2020 “Fitting a naturally scaled point system to the ACMG/AMP variant classification guidelines”

**Table 2. Recommendation for determining the appropriate ACMG/AMP evidence strength level for *de novo* occurrence(s)**

| Points | Strength Level |
|--------|----------------|
| 0.5 | Supporting (PS2_Supporting or PM6_Supporting) |
| 1 | Moderate (PS2_Moderate or PM6) |
| 2 | Strong (PS2 or PM6_Strong) |
| 4 | Very Strong (`PS2_VeryStrong or PM6_VeryStrong`) |

---

### PS3 - Functional Studies

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product.

**Note:** Functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well-established.

**VCEP Specifications:** Applied at the strong level for variants with RNA and in silico evidence of aberrant splicing. Otherwise, applied at the supporting level as described in the Supporting specification, except as noted in the Moderate specification.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Applicable to non-canonical splice site variants that have RNA and in silico evidence of aberrant splicing |
| **Moderate** | Currently applicable for variants with luciferase assay data (evidence of decreased transactivation ≤40% of wild type) by the Gloyn/Oxford group (Althari et al. 2020). This upgrade from supporting is based on a validation conducted according to the guidelines by Brnich et al. 2019 |
| **Supporting** | See approved functional studies below |

#### Approved Functional Assays (PS3_Supporting)

1. **Luciferase assays for transactivation:**
   - Less than 40% activity of wildtype (WT)
   - Assays should include controls for WT, T2DM-risk, and known MODY variants

2. **EMSA for DNA binding:**
   - Less than 40% activity of WT
   - Recommended positive controls for reduced DNA binding activity (use at least two):
     - c.335C>T (p.Pro112Leu)
     - c.608G>A (p.Arg203His)
     - c.787C>T (p.Arg263Cys)
     - c.686G>A (p.Arg229Gln)

3. **Western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence for protein expression and localization:**
   - Determining appropriate thresholds for protein expression is more difficult due to variability in results between experimental protocols
   - Altered protein expression can be indirectly captured through the `read-out frame` [sic] from transactivation assay
   - Reduced protein expression can provide an explanation for reduced transactivation
   - When exploring protein mis-localization, use c.589_615del (p.Lys197_Lys205del) as positive control for impaired nuclear localization (cytosolic retention)

---

### PS4 - Prevalence in Affected

**Original ACMG Summary:** The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls.

**Note 1:** Relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR), as obtained from case-control studies, is >5.0 and the confidence interval around the estimate of RR or OR does not include 1.0.

**Note 2:** In instances of very rare variants where case-control studies may not reach statistical significance, the prior observation of the variant in multiple unrelated patients with the same phenotype, and its absence in controls, may be used as moderate level of evidence.

**VCEP Specifications:**
- Variant should meet **PM2_Supporting** in order to use PS4 at any level
- Careful review of gnomAD QC data may be necessary to assess whether variant is real or an artifact, especially if variant is in a polyC region
- Phenotype of affected individuals must include diabetes, without clear evidence of an autoimmune etiology (see Important Phenotype Requirements above)

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Seven or more unrelated occurrences |
| **Moderate** | 4-6 unrelated occurrences |

---

### PM1 - Mutational Hot Spot

**Original ACMG Summary:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g., active site of an enzyme) without benign variation.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | Variants in residues that directly bind DNA (see list below) |
| **Supporting** | Variants in defined regions in the DNA binding and dimerization domains (see list below) |

#### PM1_Moderate - DNA Binding Residues

Apply PM1 at moderate level for variants in residues that directly bind DNA:
- Gln130, Arg131, Glu132, His143, Leu144, Ser145, Gln146, His147, Leu148, Asn149
- Lys155, Thr156, Gln157, Lys158
- Arg203, Phe204, Lys205, Trp206
- Arg263, Val264, Tyr265, Asn270, Arg271, Arg272, Lys273

#### PM1_Supporting - Functional Domains and Promoter Regions

**Protein domains:**
- **Dimerization domain:** codons 1-32 (NM_000545.8)
- **Subset of DNA binding domains:** codons 107-174 and 201-280

**Transcription factor binding sites in the promoter:**
- c.-187 to c.-195 (AP1 binding site)
- c.-209 to c.-227 (Overlapping HNF3 & NF-Y sites)
- c.-238 to c.-259 (HNF1A binding site)
- c.-276 to c.-288 (HNF4A binding site)

---

### PM2 - Absent from Controls

**Original ACMG Summary:** Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

**Caveat:** Population data for indels may be poorly called by next generation sequencing.

**VCEP Specifications:**
- Recommend using as **supporting level of evidence only** (PM2_Supporting) per ClinGen guidance
- Per guidance from ClinGen/SVI, PM2_Supporting + PVS1 is sufficient evidence of a variant being likely pathogenic
- Recommend investigating the genotype metrics in gnomAD for variants that have been flagged for having failed one or more quality parameters, as it is possible that some of these filtered variants are actually real
- The number of filtered alleles can be counted to determine whether PM2_Supporting would be met even if they were genuine calls
- If the filtered calls are sufficient in number to not meet PM2_Supporting, then do not use it
- Because it is also possible that these calls are false positives, do not use filtered variants to support BA1 or BS1

#### PM2_Supporting Threshold

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| **PM2_Supporting** | gnomAD Grpmax FAF ≤ 1:333,000 (≤ 0.000003 or 0.0003%) |

---

### PM3 - In Trans with Pathogenic

**Original ACMG Summary:** For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant.

**Note:** This requires testing of parents (or offspring) to determine phase.

**VCEP Specifications:** *Not Applicable*

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ NOT IN DISTRIBUTED PACKAGE — could not be source-verified.**
> The prior local guideline explained that HNF1A-related monogenic diabetes is autosomal dominant and therefore a recessive in-trans criterion does not apply. This is plausible and consistent with the document metadata, but the supplied source itself only marks PM3 “Not Applicable.”

---

### PM4 - Protein Length Changes

**Original ACMG Summary:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | For deletions/insertions of **`mone` [sic] than one amino acid** in a non-repeat region |
| **Supporting** | For **single amino acid** deletions/insertions |

---

### PM5 - Novel Missense at Same Residue

**Original ACMG Summary:** Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before.

**Example:** Arg156His is pathogenic; now you observe Arg156Cys.

**Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Applicable once **two amino acid changes** have been classified as pathogenic at the same amino acid residue |
| **Moderate** | The novel amino acid change must have a **Grantham distance greater than or equal to** the previously classified pathogenic variant |
| **Supporting** | Apply if the previously classified amino acid change is **likely pathogenic** (rather than pathogenic), OR if the previously classified variant is pathogenic but has a **greater Grantham distance** |

---

### PM6 - De Novo (Assumed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** *Not Applicable*

**Comments:** Subsumed by PS2.

---

### PP1 - Co-segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease.

**Note:** May be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data.

**VCEP Specifications:** Phenotype of affected individuals must include diabetes, without clear evidence of an autoimmune etiology (see Important Phenotype Requirements above).

#### PP1 Thresholds (Jarvik and Browning)

| Strength | Single Family | >1 Family |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Strong** | ≤ 1/32 (5 meioses) | ≤ 1/16 (4 meioses) |
| **Moderate** | ≤ 1/16 (4 meioses) | ≤ 1/8 (3 meioses) |
| **Supporting** | ≤ 1/8 (3 meioses) | ≤ 1/4 (2 meioses) |

---

### PP2 - Missense in Constrained Gene

**Original ACMG Summary:** Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.

**VCEP Specifications:** *Not Applicable*

**Comments:** Missense variants account for 55% of all published pathogenic variants in this gene (Colclough et al 2013), however the constraint score for HNF1A (gene) is 1.07, which is not significant; therefore, this criterion is not supported at this time. The low constraint score is most likely due to high tolerance for missense variants in the transactivation domain (see PM1 section). There are significantly more pathogenic missense variants in the DNA binding and dimerization domains, which are much less tolerant to missense variation. This may be updated in the future if domain-specific scores can be generated.

---

### PP3 - Computational Evidence

**Original ACMG Summary:** Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.).

**Caveat:** As many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion. PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.

#### PP3_Supporting

| Variant Type | Tool | Threshold |
|--------------|------|-----------|
| Missense variants | REVEL | ≥ 0.70 |
| Non-canonical splicing variants | SpliceAI | above 0.2 |
| Synonymous variants | SpliceAI | above 0.2 |

---

### PP4 - Phenotype Specificity

**Original ACMG Summary:** Patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

**VCEP Specifications:** Phenotype of affected individuals must include diabetes, without clear evidence of an autoimmune etiology (see Important Phenotype Requirements above).

#### PP4 Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | MODY Probability Calculator (MPC) result ≥50% chance of testing positive ([https://www.diabetesgenes.org/mody-probability-calculator/](https://www.diabetesgenes.org/mody-probability-calculator/)) **AND** negative HNF4A testing **AND** presence of at least one additional feature characteristic of HNF1A-MODY |
| **Supporting** | MODY Probability Calculator (MPC) result ≥50% chance of testing positive **AND** negative HNF4A testing |

#### Additional Features Characteristic of HNF1A-MODY (for PP4_Moderate)

- Antibody negative and/or persistent C-peptide after five years post-T1DM diagnosis
- Response to low-dose `sulfonyurea` [sic] (SU) (extreme response- hypoglycemia)
- Low hsCRP in patient with clinical diagnosis of T2DM
- Biochemical/Molecular phenotypic evidence from patient cell lines
- Hepatocellular adenomas

---

### PP5 - Reputable Source

**Original ACMG Summary:** Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation.

**VCEP Specifications:** *Not Applicable*

This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee (PMID: 29543229).

---

## Benign Criteria

### BA1 - Allele Frequency >5%

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is above 5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

#### BA1 Threshold (Stand Alone)

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| **BA1** | gnomAD Grpmax FAF ≥ 1:10,000 (≥ 0.01% or 0.0001) |

---

### BS1 - Frequency Greater Than Expected

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.

#### BS1 Threshold (Strong)

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| **BS1** | gnomAD Grpmax FAF ≥ 1:30,000 (≥ 0.0033% or 0.000033) |

---

### BS2 - Observed in Healthy Adult

**Original ACMG Summary:** Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.

#### BS2 Specification (Strong)

Apply to **normoglycemic individuals age 70 or older** (i.e., genotype positive, phenotype negative).

---

### BS3 - Functional Studies (No Effect)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Applicable to non-canonical splice site variants that have RNA and in silico evidence of **normal splicing** |
| **Supporting** | See approved functional studies below |

#### Approved Functional Assays (BS3_Supporting)

1. **Luciferase assays for transactivation:** ≥ 75% activity of wildtype
2. **EMSA for DNA binding:** ≥ 75% activity of wildtype
3. **Western blotting and indirect `immunoflorescence` [sic] for protein expression and localization:**
   - Determining appropriate thresholds for protein expression is more difficult due to variability in results between different experimental protocols
   - Altered protein expression can be indirectly captured through the read-out from a transactivation assay
   - Reduced protein expression can provide an explanation for reduced transactivation

---

### BS4 - Lack of Segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.

**Caveat:** The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e., cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.

#### BS4 Specification (Strong)

Applicable to family members without variant who have **MPC score >50%** (i.e., genotype negative, phenotype positive).

---

### BP1-BP7 - Benign Supporting

| Criterion | Status | Specification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **BP1** | *Not Applicable* | Missense variant in a gene for which primarily truncating variants are known to cause disease |
| **BP2** | Supporting | Observed in trans with a pathogenic variant for a fully penetrant dominant gene/disorder or observed in cis with a pathogenic variant in any inheritance pattern. **Also applicable when in cis or trans with a likely pathogenic variant.** |
| **BP3** | *Not Applicable* | In-frame deletions/insertions in a repetitive region without a known function |
| **BP4** | Supporting | Use REVEL score of **≤0.15** as supportive evidence of no predicted impact. For non-canonical splicing variants and synonymous variants: apply BP4 when SpliceAI predicted change is **below 0.2** |
| **BP5** | Supporting | A variant in other monogenic diabetes gene is P/LP |
| **BP6** | *Not Applicable* | Not for use as recommended by ClinGen SVI VCEP Review Committee (PMID: 29543229) |
| **BP7** | Supporting | Apply BP7 when SpliceAI predicted change is **below 0.2 AND phyloP100 way < 2.0** |

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Complete PVS1 Decision Tree Transcription

The following preserves every visible branch and arrow destination in `HNF1A (NM_000545.pdf`.

**Nonsense**

- Exons 1-9 (5' of c.1768); NMD expected for variants 5' of c.1714; the last 55 bp of exon 9 (c.1714-c.1768) is enriched for MODY-causing nonsense -> **PVS1**.
- Exon 10 c.1803 (p.601) and 5' (no NMD but critical to protein function) -> **PVS1_Strong**.
- Exon 10 3' of c.1803 (p.601), with limited evidence of patients with MODY phenotype -> **PVS1_Supporting**.

**Frameshift**

- Exons 1-9 (5' of c.1768); NMD expected for variants 5' of c.1714; the last 55 bp of exon 9 (c.1714-c.1768) is enriched for MODY-causing nonsense -> **PVS1**.
- Exon 10 c.1854 (p.618) and 5' (no NMD but critical to protein function) -> **PVS1_Strong**.
- Exon 10 3' of c.1854 (p.618), with limited evidence of patients with MODY phenotype -> **PVS1_Supporting**.

**`GT--AG 1,2 splice sites`**

The source label has a superscript-like `a` after “sites,” but the attachment provides no visible definition.

- Skipping exon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 9, or use of a cryptic splice site resulting in a frameshift/PTC 5' of c.1768 -> **PVS1**.
- Skipping exon 7, preserving the reading frame but removing >10% of the protein and 18% of the transactivation domain -> **PVS1**.
- Skipping exon 10, removing part of the transactivation domain -> **PVS1_Strong**.

**Deletion (single exon to full gene)**

- Full gene deletion -> **PVS1**.
- Single-to-multi-exon deletion, exons 1-9 -> **PVS1**.
- Single exon deletion, exon 10 -> **PVS1_Strong**.

**Duplication (`≥1 exon in size and must be completely contained within gene`)**

- Proven in tandem -> reading frame disrupted and NMD predicted to occur -> **PVS1**.
- Proven in tandem -> no or unknown impact on reading frame and NMD -> **N/A**.
- Presumed in tandem -> no or unknown impact on reading frame and NMD -> **N/A**.
- Presumed in tandem -> reading frame presumed disrupted and NMD predicted to occur -> **PVS1_Strong**.
- Proven not in tandem -> **N/A**.

**Initiation codon** -> **PVS1**.

### Appendix B: Population Frequency Thresholds Summary

> **Source-derived editorial reorganization:** Appendices B-E are not tables distributed in the source package. They reorganize source-derived specifications already transcribed above; the controlling criteria text remains the criterion sections and distributed attachments.

| Criterion | Threshold | Strength |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| BA1 | gnomAD Grpmax FAF ≥ 0.0001 (≥ 0.01% or 1:10,000) | Stand Alone |
| BS1 | gnomAD Grpmax FAF ≥ 0.000033 (≥ 0.0033% or 1:30,000) | Strong |
| PM2 | gnomAD Grpmax FAF ≤ 0.000003 (≤ 0.0003% or 1:333,000) | Supporting |

### Appendix C: Computational Tool Thresholds

| Tool | Pathogenic Threshold | Benign Threshold | Application |
|------|---------------------|------------------|-------------|
| REVEL | ≥ 0.70 (PP3) | ≤ 0.15 (BP4) | Missense variants |
| SpliceAI | above 0.2 (PP3) | below 0.2 (BP4, BP7) | Splicing variants |
| `phyloP100 way` [sic] | N/A | < 2.0 (BP7) | Conservation (with SpliceAI for BP7) |

### Appendix D: Functional Assay Thresholds

| Assay | PS3 Threshold (Damaging) | BS3 Threshold (Normal) |
|-------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Gloyn/Oxford luciferase transactivation (PS3_Moderate) | ≤ 40% of WT | N/A |
| Luciferase transactivation (PS3_Supporting) | less than 40% of WT | ≥ 75% of WT |
| EMSA DNA binding | less than 40% of WT | ≥ 75% of WT |

### Appendix E: Criteria Not Applicable for HNF1A

| Criterion | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| PM3 | Not Applicable; the source provides no reason (see the clearly bannered local-only context in PM3) |
| PM6 | Subsumed by PS2 |
| PP2 | Gene constraint score (1.07) is not significant |
| PP5 | Not for use per ClinGen SVI recommendation |
| BP1 | Not applicable |
| BP3 | Not applicable |
| BP6 | Not for use per ClinGen SVI recommendation |

## Version History

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| 3.1.0 | 10/10/2025 | Updating PS2 to clarify when a family history of diabetes prevents the application of this criterion. Minor edits for clarity and avoiding redundancy in the specifications. Updating citations so reference list populates. |
| 3.1.0 document corrections | 2026-08-10 | Source-faithful remediation against `ClinGen_ACMG_Specifications_HNF1A_v3.1.pdf`, `PS2 De Novo Points Table.pdf`, and `HNF1A (NM_000545.pdf`: restored complete PVS1 attachment topology; transcribed the PS2 table titles, bare cells, labels, and printed footnote exactly; preserved the core combining-rule token `PS2_Very Strong`; preserved source comparators, typos, malformed wording, and `<200pmol/L or 0.6ng/mL` spacing; surfaced the unresolved autoimmune-phenotype wording and unexplained flowchart marker; applied the required unverified-content banner to the plausible local-only PM3 rationale; labeled Appendices B-E as source-derived editorial reorganizations rather than distributed tables; and removed the generic PM6 graft. No scientific inconsistency was silently repaired. |
