## General Comments

> **Note on Multiple Modes of Inheritance:** In general, the easiest way to tell whether a variant is AD or AR is to look at the clinical situation of probands with the variant, along with the family and inheritance. If it's de novo, it's much more likely to be AD and if it's observed with a second variant, it's much more likely to be AR. Loss of function variants are almost always associated with AR disease. For truncating/putative LOF variants, this is easier to determine, but some missense variants are observed that may have LOF functional consequence. The AD and AR specifications are listed separately.

## Pathogenic Criteria

### PVS1 - Null Variant

**Original ACMG Summary:** Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical +/−1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease.

**Caveats:**
- Beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g. GFAP, MYH7)
- Use caution interpreting LOF variants at the extreme 3' end of a gene
- Use caution with splice variants that are predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the protein intact
- Use caution in the presence of multiple transcripts

#### VCEP Specification

| Strength | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Not Applicable** | Loss of function is not a mechanism of disease for autosomal dominant alpha-actinopathy caused by variants in ACTA1. |

---

### PS1 - Same Amino Acid Change

**Original ACMG Summary:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.

**Example:** Val->Leu caused by either G>C or G>T in the same codon.

**Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

#### VCEP Specification

| Strength | Specification | Modification Type |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change. Example: Val->Leu caused by either G>C or G>T in the same codon. Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level. | No change |
| **Moderate** | No change - use as originally described | No change |
| **Supporting** | No change - use as originally described | No change |

---

### PS2 - De Novo (Confirmed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history.

**Note:** Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, etc. can contribute to non-maternity.

#### VCEP Specification

| Strength | Specification | Modification Type |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Very Strong** | No change - use as originally described | No change |
| **Strong** | De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history. Note: Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, etc. can contribute to non-maternity. | No change |
| **Moderate** | No change - use as originally described | No change |
| **Supporting** | No change - use as originally described | No change |

---

### PS3 - Functional Studies

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product.

**Note:** Functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well-established.

#### VCEP Specification

| Strength | Specification | Modification Type |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | Strong may only be considered for variant-specific mouse models. Currently, no other assays are applicable at this strength. | Disease-specific |
| **Moderate** | The two assays from PS3_Supporting may be stacked to reach a Moderate Strength | Gene-specific |
| **Supporting** | Three specific assays are currently suggested to be applied at Supporting (see below) | Gene-specific |

> **Source limitation:** PS3_Moderate says “the two assays from PS3_Supporting” while PS3_Supporting lists three assay categories. The distributed specification does not identify which two are intended. Do not choose a pair by inference.

#### Approved Functional Assays (PS3_Supporting)

**1. Actin Localization**
- **Abnormal Readout:** Integration of actin into cytoplasmic or intranuclear aggregates or rods

**2. Actin Polymerization**
- **Abnormal Readout:** Significant reduction in levels of actin in insoluble fraction OR absent or short polymerized actin filaments compared to WT

**3. Actin Motility Assay**
- **Abnormal Readout:** Percent motility, velocity, and force generation statistically different from WT

#### Additional Assay Requirements

If not listed above, it is acceptable to use PS3_Supporting for other functional analyses if ALL of the following are met:
- The assay has been validated by a known pathogenic and benign variant AND
- There is plausible reason that the function the assay is testing relates to the phenotype AND
- The assay conditions are likely to mimic the physiological environment

The assay-specific evidence in the distributed workbook is transcribed in [Appendix E](#appendix-e-distributed-approved-ad-acta1-functional-assays).

---

### PS4 - Prevalence in Affected

**Original ACMG Summary:** The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls.

**Note 1:** Relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR), as obtained from case-control studies, is >5.0 and the confidence interval around the estimate of RR or OR does not include 1.0.

**Note 2:** In instances of very rare variants where case-control studies may not reach statistical significance, the prior observation of the variant in multiple unrelated patients with the same phenotype, and its absence in controls, may be used as moderate level of evidence.

#### VCEP Specifications

> ACTA1 is associated with both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant disease. If you are curating biallelic observations, please use the AR specifications.

> Cases should not be counted if there are complex phenotypic features in addition to those listed that are incompatible with ACTA1, such as neurogenic etiology, central nervous system involvement, lysosomal disorders, increased serum CK levels, or extraocular muscle weakness.

| Strength | Case Observations Required | Modification Type |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | 8 case observations | Gene-specific |
| **Moderate** | 4 case observations | Gene-specific |
| **Supporting** | 2 case observations | Gene-specific |

---

### PM1 - Mutational Hot Spot

**Original ACMG Summary:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation.

#### VCEP Specification

| Strength | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Not Applicable** | There are no defined hotspots or critical functional domains in ACTA1 at this time. |

---

### PM2 - Absent from Controls

**Original ACMG Summary:** Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

**Caveat:** Population data for indels may be poorly called by next generation sequencing.

#### VCEP Specifications

> If the mode of inheritance for the variant is unclear (largely with missense variants as loss of function variants are predicted to cause AR disease), use the more conservative AD cutoff for PM2_Supporting.

| Strength | Specification | Modification Type |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Supporting** | PM2_Supporting may be applied if the minor allele frequency in population databases of at least 2000 alleles is **absent (1 allele allowed)** for autosomal dominant | Disease-specific, Gene-specific |

---

### PM3 - In Trans with Pathogenic

**Original ACMG Summary:** For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant.

**Note:** This requires testing of parents (or offspring) to determine phase.

#### VCEP Specification

| Strength | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Not Applicable** | Biallelic cases should not be counted using the ACTA1 autosomal dominant specifications. Please see the autosomal recessive specifications for use of PM3. |

---

### PM4 - Protein Length Changes

**Original ACMG Summary:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

#### VCEP Specification

| Strength | Specification | Modification Type |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | No change - use as originally described | No change |
| **Moderate** | Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants | No change |
| **Supporting** | No change - use as originally described | No change |

---

### PM5 - Novel Missense at Same Residue

**Original ACMG Summary:** Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before.

**Example:** Arg156His is pathogenic; now you observe Arg156Cys.

**Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

#### VCEP Specification

| Strength | Specification | Modification Type |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | No change - use as originally described | No change |
| **Moderate** | Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before. Example: Arg156His is pathogenic; now you observe Arg156Cys. Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level. | No change |
| **Supporting** | No change - use as originally described | No change |

---

### PM6 - De Novo (Assumed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity.

#### VCEP Specification

| Strength | Specification | Modification Type |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | No change - use as originally described | No change |
| **Moderate** | Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity | No change |
| **Supporting** | No change - use as originally described | No change |

---

### PP1 - Co-segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease.

**Note:** May be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data.

#### VCEP Specifications

> The segregation chart (adopted from Biesecker et al 2023 PMID:38103548) should be used to determine the strength level of the total number of segregations. **The combination of PP1 and PP4 is capped at strong.**

| Strength | Specification | Modification Type |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | See segregation chart | General recommendation |
| **Moderate** | See segregation chart | General recommendation |
| **Supporting** | Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease. See segregation chart | General recommendation |

#### Distributed PP1 Segregation Chart

The attachment reproduces Table 3, “Points derived for co-segregations for traits,” from Biesecker et al. 2023:

| Segregation type | 1 individual | 2 individuals | 3 individuals | 4 individuals | 5 individuals |
|------------------|-------------:|--------------:|--------------:|--------------:|--------------:|
| Autosomal-recessive affected (footnotes b,c) | 2.0 | 4.0 | 6.0 | 8.0 | 10.0 |
| Autosomal-recessive unaffected (footnote a) | 0.4 | 0.8 | 1.2 | 1.6 | 2.0 (footnote d) |
| **Autosomal-dominant affected and unaffected (footnote a)** | **1.0** | **2.0** | **3.0** | **4.0** | **5.0** |
| X-linked-recessive male affected and unaffected (footnote e) | 1.0 | 2.0 | 3.0 | 4.0 | 5.0 |

- **a:** Only count unaffected individuals if disease is fully penetrant. Do not count unaffected parents used to establish phase.
- **b:** These points apply to the allele; if more than one variant is on that allele, divide the evidence for the allele by the number of variants.
- **c:** Cap all locus evidence (PP1 and PP4) above +5.0 points per allele.
- **d:** Continue adding +0.4 points for each meiosis above five.
- **e:** Additional segregations can be counted for obligate heterozygous females.

> **Source limitation:** The attachment supplies points but does not map point totals to PP1 Supporting, Moderate, or Strong, even though the core specification directs all three strengths to the chart. The core separately says that PP1 plus PP4 is capped at Strong, while attachment footnote c literally caps locus evidence above +5.0 points per allele. Both statements are preserved; the absent point-to-strength conversion must not be inferred.

### PP2 - Missense in Constrained Gene

**Original ACMG Summary:** Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.

#### VCEP Specification

| Strength | Specification | Modification Type |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Supporting** | ACTA1 is a gene that is constrained for missense variation (gnomAD v4.1 z=6.09). PP2 may be used for missense variants with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. | Gene-specific |

---

### PP3 - Computational Evidence

**Original ACMG Summary:** Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.).

**Caveat:** As many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion. PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.

#### VCEP Specification

| Strength | Specification | Modification Type |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Supporting** | PP3 is met if the **REVEL score ≥ 0.7** OR if the variant is predicted to impact splicing using **SpliceAI score ≥ 0.5** | General recommendation |

---

### PP4 - Phenotype Specificity

**Original ACMG Summary:** Patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

#### VCEP Specifications

> The strength of PP4 should be determined based on the case with the most specific phenotype. It should only be applied once per variant, even if there are multiple cases that meet PP4 criteria. **The combination of PP4 and PP1 is capped at strong.**

> For ACTA1, a conservative estimate of the diagnostic yield is 33%, which corresponds to +2 points and a moderate strength in Table 2 of the Biesecker et al 2023 guidance.

| Strength | Specification | Modification Type |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | If the proband meets PP4_Moderate criteria AND has had a comprehensive myopathy panel, exome, or genome testing that is negative for all other causes of myopathy, PP4 can be applied at strong, per the SVI guidance. | Disease-specific, Gene-specific |
| **Moderate** | PP4_Moderate is met with the presence of any of these features on **Muscle Biopsy**: Accumulated thin filaments, Intranuclear rods, Cores/fiber type disproportion, Zebra bodies | Disease-specific, Gene-specific |
| **Supporting** | If a biopsy demonstrates a presence of nemaline rods, this is suggestive of ACTA1-related congenital myopathy and can be given PP4 at a supporting level. | Disease-specific, Gene-specific |

#### PP4 Muscle Biopsy Features

| Feature | PP4 Level |
|---------|-----------|
| Nemaline rods | Supporting |
| Accumulated thin filaments | Moderate |
| Intranuclear rods | Moderate |
| Cores, fiber type disproportion | Moderate |
| Zebra bodies | Moderate |
| Meets Moderate criteria + negative comprehensive testing | Strong |

---

### PP5 - Reputable Source

**Original ACMG Summary:** Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation.

#### VCEP Specification

| Strength | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Not Applicable** | This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee (PMID: 29543229). |

---

## Benign Criteria

### BA1 - Allele Frequency >5%

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is above 5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

#### VCEP Specifications

> If the mode of inheritance for the variant is unclear (this largely applies to missense variants as loss of function variants are suspected to cause AR disease), use the more conservative AR cutoff for BA1.

| Strength | Specification | Modification Type |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Stand Alone** | The minor allele frequency using the filtering allele frequency of either exomes or genomes in gnomAD is **≥ 0.0000781** for AD variants. All continental populations in gnomAD used should have at least 2000 alleles and >1 observation. | Gene-specific |

---

### BS1 - Frequency Greater Than Expected

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.

#### VCEP Specifications

> If the mode of inheritance for the variant is unclear (this largely applies to missense variants as loss of function variants are suspected to cause AR disease), use the more conservative AR cutoff for BS1.

| Strength | Specification | Modification Type |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | The minor allele frequency using the filtering allele frequency of either exomes or genomes in gnomAD is **≥ 0.00000781** for AD variants. All continental populations used in gnomAD should have at least 2000 alleles and >1 observation. | Gene-specific |

---

### BS2 - Observed in Healthy Adult

**Original ACMG Summary:** Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.

#### VCEP Specification

| Strength | Specification | Modification Type |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age. | No change |
| **Moderate** | No change - use as originally described | No change |
| **Supporting** | No change - use as originally described | No change |

---

### BS3 - Functional Studies (No Effect)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.

#### VCEP Specification

| Strength | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Not Applicable** | The VCEP has decided that lack of demonstrated effect in a functional assay should not count against the pathogenicity of an ACTA1 variant because of the numerous possible functions of Actin; therefore all specified functional assays will only be used as evidence for pathogenicity. |

---

### BS4 - Lack of Segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.

**Caveat:** The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e. cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.

#### VCEP Specification

| Strength | Specification | Modification Type |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | Lack of segregation in affected members of a family. Caveat: The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e. cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation. | No change |
| **Moderate** | No change - use as originally described | No change |
| **Supporting** | No change - use as originally described | No change |

---

### BP1-BP7 - Benign Supporting

| Criterion | Status | Specification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **BP1** | Not Applicable | Both missense and truncating variants in ACTA1 are disease-causing. |
| **BP2** | Supporting | Observed in trans with a pathogenic variant for a fully penetrant dominant gene/disorder or observed in cis with a pathogenic variant in any inheritance pattern. (No change) |
| **BP3** | Not Applicable | There are no regions in ACTA1 where BP3 would apply. |
| **BP4** | Supporting | BP4 is met if the **REVEL score ≤ 0.15** OR if the variant is not predicted to impact splicing using SpliceAI. (General recommendation) |
| **BP5** | Supporting | Variant found in a case with an alternate molecular basis for disease. (No change) |
| **BP6** | Not Applicable | This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen SVI VCEP Review Committee (PMID: 29543229). |
| **BP7** | Supporting | A synonymous variant for which SpliceAI predicts no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved. (General recommendation) |

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Population Frequency Thresholds Summary

| Criterion | Threshold (AD) | Strength |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| BA1 | ≥ 0.0000781 | Stand Alone |
| BS1 | ≥ 0.00000781 | Strong |
| PM2 | Absent (1 allele allowed) | Supporting |

**Notes:**
- BA1 and BS1 use gnomAD filtering allele frequency from either exomes or genomes; the PM2 source text instead says minor allele frequency in population databases and does not specify filtering allele frequency
- For BA1 and BS1, all continental populations used should have at least 2000 alleles and >1 observation; PM2 separately requires a population database with at least 2000 alleles
- If mode of inheritance is unclear, BA1 and BS1 use the more conservative AR cutoffs, while PM2_Supporting uses the more conservative AD cutoff

### Appendix B: Computational Predictor Thresholds

| Criterion | Predictor | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| PP3 (Pathogenic) | REVEL | ≥ 0.7 |
| PP3 (Pathogenic) | SpliceAI | ≥ 0.5 |
| BP4 (Benign) | REVEL | ≤ 0.15 |
| BP4 (Benign) | SpliceAI | No impact predicted |

### Appendix C: Criteria Not Applicable for ACTA1-AD

| Criterion | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| PVS1 | LOF is not a mechanism of disease for AD alpha-actinopathy |
| PM1 | No defined hotspots or critical functional domains |
| PM3 | Not applicable for AD; use AR specifications for biallelic cases |
| BS3 | Lack of effect in functional assays does not count against pathogenicity due to numerous actin functions |
| BP1 | Both missense and truncating variants cause disease |
| BP3 | No applicable regions in ACTA1 |
| PP5/BP6 | Not recommended by ClinGen SVI VCEP Review Committee |

### Appendix D: Phenotypic Features Incompatible with ACTA1

Cases should **not** be counted for PS4 if they have complex phenotypic features incompatible with ACTA1, such as:
- Neurogenic etiology
- Central nervous system involvement
- Lysosomal disorders
- Increased serum CK levels
- Extraocular muscle weakness

### Appendix E: Distributed Approved AD ACTA1 Functional Assays

The distributed workbook contains three visible sheets and identifies every populated literature column below as an approved assay at **Supporting** strength. Its “Proposed strength (modified)” row is blank throughout. Blank variant and note fields below are also blank in the source. The workbook frequently records zero or unmet validation controls and absent quantitative thresholds; those source limitations are reported rather than reconciled with the generic requirements for other, unlisted assays.

### Appendix F: Distributed-Source Limitations

- The PP1 attachment gives points but no point-to-strength mapping; see the PP1 section.
- PS3_Moderate refers to “the two assays” while PS3_Supporting lists three assay categories and does not identify a pair.
- The approved-assay workbook contains unresolved questions, unfinished control descriptions, zero or unmet validation controls, and many missing thresholds. These are limitations of the distributed source, not gaps to fill with generic assay guidance.

## Version History

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| 2.0.0 | 2026-08-09 | **Document corrections (ClinGen version unchanged):** Verified against `ClinGen_ACMG_Specifications_ACTA1_v2.0.pdf`, `Approved AD ACTA1 functional assays.xlsx`, and `PP1 segregation chart.docx`. Replaced an undistributed likelihood-ratio/LOD PP1 table with the actual attached co-segregation point chart and all footnotes, including the literal “each meiosis above five” wording; documented the missing point-to-strength conversion and preserved both cap wordings. Transcribed all 15 approved Supporting assay columns and their controls, thresholds, variants, notes, blanks, and source typos from the functional workbook; documented the unresolved PS3 “two assays” wording. Corrected Appendix A so PM2 is not represented as a gnomAD filtering-allele-frequency or continental-population rule. Restored the specification DOI and all 14 source-supplied reference DOIs. |
| 2.0.0 | 8/27/2024 | BS1 and BA1 thresholds were accidentally switched. Those have been corrected in this 2.0 version. |
