## Pathogenic Criteria

### PVS1 - Null Variant

**Original ACMG Summary:** Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical ±1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease.

**VCEP Specifications:**
- Most terminal codon expected to undergo NMD: **p.Thr1586**
- For splice site variants, PVS1 should **not** be applied in combination with PP3
- For a full gene deletion, a **Pathogenic** classification is warranted
- Follow SVI guidance per workflow in Tayoun et al (2018) — see [Appendix A: PVS1 Decision Tree](#appendix-a-pvs1-decision-tree)

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Very Strong** | Follow the shipped decision tree. It routes NMD-predicted nonsense/frameshift variants in the biologically relevant transcript, qualifying frame-disrupting canonical splice variants/deletions with NMD, proven-in-tandem frame-disrupting duplications with NMD, and full-gene deletions to PVS1. |
| **Strong** | For an NMD-escaping or in-frame outcome: truncated/altered region is critical to protein function, **or** role is unknown, LoF variants are not frequent/the exon is present, and the variant removes **>10%** of protein (**≥200 aa**). Also applies to a presumed-in-tandem duplication with presumed frame disruption and NMD. |
| **Moderate** | For an NMD-escaping or in-frame outcome where region function is unknown, LoF variants are not frequent/the exon is present, and the variant removes **<10%** of protein (**<200 aa**); or an initiation-codon variant with no alternative start and ≥1 Pathogenic variant upstream of the closest in-frame start. |
| **Supporting** | For an initiation-codon variant with no alternative start and **no** Pathogenic variant upstream of the closest in-frame start (printed as `PVS1_Supp` in the deck). A different functional transcript with an alternative start routes to **N/A**, not Supporting. |

> **Unresolved source issues:** The decision tree uses strict **>10%** and **<10%** branches, leaving exactly 10% unassigned. The core says a full-gene deletion warrants **Pathogenic**, but the tree assigns PVS1 (8 points) and the shipped points table classifies 6-9 points as **Likely Pathogenic**. Report these readings; do not reconcile them.

---

### PS1 - Same Amino Acid Change

**Original ACMG Summary:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.

**VCEP Specifications:**

The paralogous sodium channel genes associated with “neurodevelomental” **[sic]** disorders (SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN8A) share >77% sequence identity (PMID:33531663). The four homologous domains with voltage sensor and pore region remain largely preserved across the channels. When terminal regions and cytoplasmic loops are excluded, homology increases to >90% (PMID:33531663; PMID:16382098).

As such, **Pathogenic and Likely Pathogenic variants in paralogous genes can be considered for PS1.** See [Appendix D: Paralogous Gene Table](#appendix-d-paralogous-gene-table).

PS1 can also be applied for **splice variants** at varying strengths, in conjunction with either PP3 or PVS1. See [Appendix E: PS1 Splice Variant Table](#appendix-e-ps1-splice-variant-table).

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Same amino acid change as a previously established **Pathogenic** variant regardless of nucleotide change; or >1 identical amino acid change in a qualifying paralog previously established as Pathogenic or Likely Pathogenic. |
| **Moderate** | Same amino acid change as a previously established **Likely Pathogenic** variant regardless of nucleotide change. |
| **Supporting** | A single identical amino acid change in a qualifying paralog previously established as Pathogenic or Likely Pathogenic. |

For splice variants, do **not** infer strength solely from whether the comparison variant is Pathogenic or Likely Pathogenic. Use the six-row Walker et al. matrix in [Appendix E](#appendix-e-ps1-splice-variant-table); strength also depends on the VUA baseline code and both variants' positions.

> **Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

---

### PS2 - De Novo (Confirmed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history.

**VCEP Specifications:** Points-based system for each unrelated proband, determined by phenotypic specificity. Both maternity and paternity must be confirmed.

> **Note:** Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, etc. can contribute to non-maternity.

#### PS2 Point System (Per Confirmed De Novo Proband)

| Phenotype | Points per Proband |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy | **1 point** |
| Other phenotypes not consistent with neurodevelopmental disorder | **0 points** |

#### PS2 Evidence Strength Thresholds

| Total Points | Strength Level |
|--------------|----------------|
| 0.5 exactly | PS2_Supporting |
| 1.0 exactly | PS2_Moderate |
| 2.0 exactly | PS2_Strong |
| 4.0 exactly | PS2_Very Strong |

> The VCEP gives these as exact totals and does not specify how intermediate or higher totals should be assigned.

---

### PS3 - Functional Studies

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product.

**VCEP Specifications:**
- If a variant shows differences from wildtype at **multiple strength levels** (e.g., strong-level evidence in peak current and moderate-level evidence in persistent current), use the **highest** level of evidence (capping at Strong).
- If a variant has been studied in **multiple publications**, use the strongest level of evidence available.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | **Patch clamping:** Peak current ≤72.7% of wildtype, **OR** persistent current ≥135% of wildtype, **OR** voltage dependence of activation shifted by ≥2.2 mV (absolute value), **OR** voltage dependence of inactivation shifted by ≥4.1 mV (absolute value). **Mouse model:** Knock-in displays spontaneous seizures. |
| **Moderate** | **Patch clamping:** Peak current ≤80.6% of wildtype, **OR** persistent current ≥125% of wildtype, **OR** voltage dependence of activation shifted by ≥2.1 mV (absolute value), **OR** voltage dependence of inactivation shifted by ≥3.0 mV (absolute value). **Mouse model:** Knock-in displays induced seizures. **Zebrafish model:** Knock-in displays spontaneous seizures evidenced by hyperexcitability through electrophysiology or calcium imaging. |
| **Supporting** | **Zebrafish model:** Knock-in displays induced seizures evidenced by hyperexcitability through electrophysiology or calcium imaging. |

#### PS3 Functional Assay Thresholds Summary

| Assay Parameter | Strong (PS3) | Moderate (PS3_Moderate) |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Peak current (% of WT) | ≤72.7% | ≤80.6% |
| Persistent current (% of WT) | ≥135% | ≥125% |
| V½ activation shift (mV, absolute) | ≥2.2 | ≥2.1 |
| V½ inactivation shift (mV, absolute) | ≥4.1 | ≥3.0 |

> All electrophysiology parameters are as defined by the FENICS ontology (https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/FENICS).

---

### PS4 - Prevalence in Affected

**Original ACMG Summary:** The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls.

**VCEP Specifications:** Points-based system for each unrelated proband, determined by phenotypic specificity.

| Phenotype | Points per Proband |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy | **1 point** |
| Other phenotypes not consistent with neurodevelopmental disorder | **0 points** |

#### PS4 Evidence Strength Thresholds

| Total Points | Strength Level |
|--------------|----------------|
| 1–1.5 | PS4_Supporting |
| 2–3.5 | PS4_Moderate |
| 4–15.5 | PS4_Strong |
| 16+ | PS4_Very Strong |

> Source wording retained: “Present in in” **[sic]** multiple unrelated patients.

---

### PM1 - Mutational Hot Spot

**Original ACMG Summary:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain without benign variation.

**VCEP Specifications:**

Pathogenic Enriched Regions (PERs) are regions enriched for Pathogenic variants (ClinVar/HGMD) across gene families and lacking population (gnomAD) variants (Pérez-Palma, 2020 PMID:31871067; Lal et al, 2020 PMID:32183904).

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | Variant is located within a Pathogenic Enriched Region. See PM1 Table below. |

> **Rule Combining Stipulation:**
> - PP3 + PM1 combined can reach **no higher than Strong**
> - When PM5_Strong is reached, do **not** combine PM1 with PM5

#### PM1 Pathogenic Enriched Regions (SCN3A)

| PER # | SCN3A Residues | # Residues |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | 212–230 | 19 |
| 2 | 247–255 | 9 |

| 15 | 1641–1659 | 19 |
| 16 | 1756–1769 | 14 |

> See attached "PM1 Table" for corresponding residue positions in paralogous genes (SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN8A).

---

### PM2 - Absent from Controls

**Original ACMG Summary:** Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in population databases.

**VCEP Specification (Supporting only):**
- **≤1 allele** in population databases (e.g., gnomAD), if a minimum of 10,000 alleles assessed
- Caveat: Population data for indels may be poorly called by next generation sequencing

---

### PM3 - In Trans with Pathogenic

**Original ACMG Summary:** For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant.

**VCEP Specifications:** **Not Applicable** — SCN3A is associated with autosomal dominant inheritance.

---

### PM4 - Protein Length Changes

**Original ACMG Summary:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants. (No change from original ACMG.) |

---

### PM5 - Novel Missense at Same Residue

**Original ACMG Summary:** Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before.

**VCEP Specifications:**

The paralogous sodium channel genes (SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN8A) share >77% sequence identity. Pathogenic and Likely Pathogenic variants in paralogous genes can be considered for PM5. See [Appendix D: Paralogous Gene Table](#appendix-d-paralogous-gene-table).

> **Rule Combining Stipulation:** If PM5_Strong is reached, and the variant falls within a PM1 region, then do **not** add PM1 with PM5_Strong.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | ≥2 known Pathogenic variants at the same site as the novel change (within the same gene). |
| **Moderate** | Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be **Pathogenic** has been seen before. |
| **Supporting** | Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be **Likely Pathogenic** has been seen before. **OR** >1 non-identical amino acid change in qualifying paralogous gene(s) where a different missense change is “Pathogenicor” **[sic]** Likely Pathogenic. |

> **Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

---

### PM6 - De Novo (Assumed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** Points-based system (same structure as PS2 but with half points since parental relationships are unconfirmed).

#### PM6 Point System (Per Assumed De Novo Proband)

| Phenotype | Points per Proband |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy | **0.5 points** |
| Other phenotypes not consistent with neurodevelopmental disorder | **0 points** |

#### PM6 Evidence Strength Thresholds

|--------------|----------------|
| 0.5 exactly | PM6_Supporting |
| 1.0 exactly | PM6_Moderate |
| 2.0 exactly | PM6_Strong |
| 4.0 exactly | PM6_Very Strong |

> The VCEP gives these as exact totals and does not state that PS2 and PM6 points may be pooled. Do not infer unprinted intermediate totals or cross-criterion summation.

---

### PP1 - Co-segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Meioses Required |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Supporting** | 3–4 independent meioses |
| **Moderate** | 5–6 independent meioses |
| **Strong** | ≥7 independent meioses |

---

### PP2 - Missense in Constrained Gene

**Original ACMG Summary:** Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.

**VCEP Specifications:** **Not Applicable** — Benign missense variants are common.

---

### PP3 - Computational Evidence

**Original ACMG Summary:** Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product.

**VCEP Specifications:**

Follow ClinGen's recommendations (PMID:36413997), using **REVEL** as the computational tool.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | REVEL score meets the moderate threshold per ClinGen SVI recommendations (PMID:36413997). |
| **Supporting** | REVEL score meets the supporting threshold per ClinGen SVI recommendations (PMID:36413997). |

> **Stipulations:**
> 1. Strength should be **capped at Moderate**
> 2. Limit the combination of PP3 and PM1 to reach **no higher than Strong**
> 3. For splice site variants, PP3 should **not** be combined with PVS1

---

### PP4 - Phenotype Specificity

**Original ACMG Summary:** Patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

**VCEP Specifications:** **Not Applicable** — Phenotypic specificity is incorporated into PS2, PM6, and PS4 point systems.

---

### PP5 - Reputable Source

**Original ACMG Summary:** Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation.

**VCEP Specifications:** **Not Applicable** — This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen SVI VCEP Review Committee (PMID:29543229).

---

## Benign Criteria

### BA1 - Conflicting Source Thresholds

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is above 5% in population databases.

**Unresolved distributed-source contradiction:**

- The VCEP-specification paragraph says allele frequency is above **0.02%** in “GnomAD” or another large population database.
- The Stand Alone block says, verbatim, “Allele frequency is above **0.01% is gnomAD**” **[sic]** or another large population database, with ≥5 alleles if at least 10,000 alleles were assessed.

Do not silently choose between these thresholds.

---

### BS1 - Frequency Greater Than Expected

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.

**VCEP Specification (Strong):**
- Allele frequency is above **0.0002%** (0.000002) in gnomAD or other large population databases
- Must be ≥5 alleles if a minimum of 10,000 alleles was assessed

---

### BS2 - Observed in Healthy Adult

**Original ACMG Summary:** Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.

**VCEP Specification (Strong):**
- Observed in a healthy adult individual. (No change from original ACMG.)

---

### BS3 - Functional Studies (No Effect)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.

**VCEP Specifications:** **Not Applicable**

> **Rationale:**
> - **Cellular electrophysiology (voltage clamp recording):** Values indicating "no impact on channel function" have not been sufficiently characterized to date. Additionally, one cannot exclude non-electrophysiological defects such as mis-localization in a neuron based solely on heterologous expression studies. This can be re-assessed over time as benign variants are functionally characterized.
> - **Animal models:** Lack of an epilepsy phenotype in an animal model is insufficient to support benignity. Some non-epilepsy co-morbidities (behavioral characteristics mimicking intellectual disability and/or autism spectrum disorder) are still being established and could support pathogenicity. This can be re-assessed over time.

---

### BS4 - Lack of Segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.

**VCEP Specifications:** **Not Applicable** — Reduced penetrance and phenocopies preclude the use of this criterion.

---

### BP1-BP7 - Benign Supporting

| Criterion | Status | Comment |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **BP1** | Not Applicable | Missense variants are a common cause of disease |
| **BP2** | Applicable (Supporting) | Observed in trans with a pathogenic variant for a fully penetrant dominant gene/disorder or observed in cis with a pathogenic variant in any inheritance pattern. No change. |
| **BP3** | Applicable (Supporting) | In-frame deletions/insertions in a repetitive region without a known function. No change. |
| **BP4** | Applicable (Supporting/Moderate) | Follow ClinGen's recommendations (PMID:36413997) using REVEL as the computational tool. |
| **BP5** | Applicable (Supporting) | Variant found in a case with an alternate molecular basis for disease. No change. |
| **BP6** | Not Applicable | Not for use per ClinGen SVI VCEP Review Committee (PMID:29543229) |
| **BP7** | Applicable (Supporting) | A synonymous variant for which splicing prediction algorithms predict no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved. No change. |

---

## Rules for Combining Criteria

> **This VCEP uses a points-based system** based on “Tavtigan” **[sic]** et al, 2018 in conjunction with forthcoming points-based guidance.

### Points per Criterion

| Evidence Category | Points |
|-------------------|--------|
| Pathogenic Very Strong | **8** |
| Pathogenic Strong | **4** |
| Pathogenic Moderate | **2** |
| Pathogenic Supporting | **1** |
| Benign Supporting | **-1** |
| Benign Strong | **-4** |

### Classification Based on Total Points

| Total Points | Classification | Posterior Probability |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| ≥10 | **Pathogenic** | ≥0.99 |
| 6–9 | **Likely Pathogenic** | ≥0.9 to <0.99 |
| 0–5 | **VUS** | ≥0.10 to <0.9 |
| -6 to -1 | **Likely Benign** | ≥0.001, <0.1 |
| -7 and below | **Benign** | <0.001 |

### Benign Stand-Alone

BA1 is applied as a **stand-alone** criterion — if BA1 is met, the variant is classified as **Benign** regardless of other criteria.

### Additional Combining Caveats

- **PP3 + PM1** combined can reach **no higher than Strong**
- When **PM5_Strong** is reached, do **not** combine PM1 with PM5

> The criterion-enumeration table printed in the core PDF is intentionally omitted here because the core explicitly instructs readers to disregard its “Rules for Combining Criteria” section. The shipped `Combining Rules.pdf` supplies only the point values, classification bands, posterior probabilities, and two caveats transcribed above.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: PVS1 Decision Tree

The PVS1 decision tree follows SVI guidance per Tayoun et al (2018), with SCN3A-specific parameters:

- **Biologically-relevant transcript:** NM_006922.4 (MANE Select)
- **Most terminal codon for NMD:** p.Thr1586
- **Truncated/altered region critical to protein function** defined as:
  - (a) Presence of non-truncating pathogenic (per these criteria) variants, OR
  - (b) Located within a Pathogenic Enriched Region defined by PM1

#### Variant Types and PVS1 Strength

**Nonsense or Frameshift:**
- Predicted to undergo NMD (stop codon 5' of p.Thr1586) → **PVS1**
- Not predicted to undergo NMD (stop codon 3' of p.Thr1586):
  - Truncated region is critical to protein function → **PVS1_Strong**
  - Role of region unknown + LoF variants frequent / exon absent from relevant transcript → **N/A**
  - Role of region unknown + LoF variants not frequent / exon present + removes >10% protein (≥200 aa) → **PVS1_Strong**
  - Role of region unknown + removes <10% protein (<200 aa) → **PVS1_Moderate**

**Canonical ±1,2 Splice Sites** (if applied, PP3 not to be used in combination):
- Exon skipping disrupts reading frame + NMD predicted → **PVS1**
- Exon skipping disrupts reading frame + NMD NOT predicted:
  - Truncated region is critical → **PVS1_Strong**
  - Removes >10% protein (≥200 aa) → **PVS1_Strong**
  - Removes <10% protein (<200 aa) → **PVS1_Moderate**
- Exon skipping preserves reading frame:
  - Truncated/altered region is critical → **PVS1_Strong**
  - Removes >10% protein (≥200 aa) → **PVS1_Strong**
  - Removes <10% protein (<200 aa) → **PVS1_Moderate**
- LoF variants in exon frequent in general population / exon absent from biologically-relevant transcript → **N/A**

**Deletion (Single exon to full gene):**
- Full gene deletion → **PVS1** (Pathogenic classification warranted)
- Disrupts reading frame + NMD predicted → **PVS1**
- Disrupts reading frame + NMD NOT predicted → same as nonsense/frameshift rules above
- Preserves reading frame:
  - Truncated/altered region is critical → **PVS1_Strong**
  - Removes >10% protein (≥200 aa) → **PVS1_Strong**
  - Removes <10% protein (<200 aa) → **PVS1_Moderate**

For every role-unknown branch above, frequent LoF variation in the exon or absence from the biologically relevant transcript routes to **N/A**; the percentage/length branches apply only when LoF variants are not frequent and the exon is present.

**Duplication (≥1 exon, completely contained within gene):**
- Proven in tandem + reading frame disrupted + NMD predicted → **PVS1**
- Proven in tandem + no/unknown impact on reading frame → **N/A**
- Presumed in tandem + reading frame presumed disrupted + NMD predicted → **PVS1_Strong**
- Proven NOT in tandem → **N/A**

**Initiation Codon:**
- Different functional transcript uses alternative start codon → **N/A**
- No known alternative start codon:
  - ≥1 pathogenic variant upstream of closest potential in-frame start codon → **PVS1_Moderate**
  - No pathogenic variant upstream → **PVS1_Supporting** (printed `PVS1_Supp` in the source deck)

> **Unassigned boundary:** the deck uses `>10%` and `<10%`; exactly 10% is not assigned. It separately pairs these branches with `≥200 aa` and `<200 aa`.

> **Full-gene-deletion contradiction:** the core says a full-gene deletion warrants Pathogenic, the tree routes it to PVS1, and the shipped points table places PVS1's 8 points in Likely Pathogenic. Preserve all three readings.

> **Attachment provenance:** The 16-row PER summary above is condensed from the physically distributed `PM1 Table.xlsx` (249 residue rows). The separate, physically distributed `Paralogous Gene Table.xlsx` contains a 2,044-row whole-protein residue alignment across SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, and SCN8A, including `NA` alignment gaps. It contains no variants or classifications and should not be described as a comprehensive variant catalogue.

### Appendix E: PS1 Splice Variant Table

PS1 code weights for variants with the same predicted splicing event as a known (likely) pathogenic variant. From Walker et al, 2023 (PMID:37352859), Table 2.

| Variant Under Assessment (VUA) Location | Baseline Code | Comparison Variant Position | PS1 with P Comparison | PS1 with LP Comparison |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Outside splice ±1,2 dinucleotide | PP3 | Same nucleotide | PS1 | PS1_Moderate |
| Outside splice ±1,2 dinucleotide | PP3 | Within same splice motif (including ±1,2) | PS1_Moderate | PS1_Supporting |
| At splice ±1,2 dinucleotide | PVS1 | Within same splice ±1,2 dinucleotide | PS1_Supporting | N/A |
| At splice ±1,2 dinucleotide | PVS1 | Within same splice motif, outside ±1,2 | PS1_Supporting | PS1_Supporting |
| At splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 dinucleotide | PVS1_Strong/Moderate/Supporting | Within same splice ±1,2 dinucleotide | PS1 | N/A |
| At splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 dinucleotide | PVS1_Strong/Moderate/Supporting | Within same splice motif, outside ±1,2 | PS1_Moderate | PS1_Supporting |

## Version History

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Document corrections | 2026-08-10 | Source-first remediation against all seven distributed files: `ClinGen_ACMG_Specifications_SCN3A_v2.1.pdf`, `PVS1 Decision Tree.pptx`, `PVS1 exon numbering.xlsx`, `PM1 Table.xlsx`, `Paralogous Gene Table.xlsx`, `Combining Rules.pdf`, and `PS1_Variants impacting splicing.pdf`. Corrected reversed/incorrect PVS1 branches and strict percentage comparators; exposed transcript, BA1, full-gene-deletion, and exact-10% source conflicts; changed PS2/PM6 invented ≥ thresholds to the VCEP's exact totals; removed the unshipped PS2/PM6 pooling claim, the core criterion-enumeration table the VCEP says to disregard, and an unattributed derived criteria-summary appendix; clarified PS1 splice-matrix use and exact PM1/paralog workbook provenance; retained and flagged source typos. |
| 2.1.0 | 4/28/2025 | Making PVS1 flowchart available |
