## 1. General Information

### Gene Information

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Gene** | PIK3CD (HGNC:8977) |
| **HGNC Name** | Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta |
| **Canonical Transcript** | NM_005026.3 |
| **Disease** | Immunodeficiency 14 (MONDO:0014222) |
| **Mode of Inheritance** | Autosomal dominant |
| **Disease Mechanism** | Gain-of-function (GOF) |

### General Comments

The current specifications for PIK3CD variant curation are written in relation to **autosomal dominant** rather than autosomal recessive forms of disease, with a **gain-of-function** rather than loss-of-function mechanism of pathogenicity.

> **Important:** There is no a priori way to exclude one mode of inheritance or the other, so both need to be considered initially while assessing the variant. However, in general, only variants predicted to lead to a **single missense amino acid substitution** have thus far been shown to have a gain-of-function (GOF) effect in PIK3CD, so any other types of variants should not enter this classification criteria.

---

## 2. Scope and Disease Mechanism

### Applicable Variant Types

These specifications apply to:
- **Missense variants** associated with gain-of-function mechanism
- Variants evaluated for autosomal dominant PIK3CD-related immunodeficiency (APDS1)

### Variants Outside Scope

Variants with predicted impact on splicing (SpliceAI Δ score ≥0.2) should **not** be evaluated using these specifications but rather using alternative specifications for autosomal recessive disease with a loss-of-function mechanism, unless functional evidence indicates a gain-of-function effect.

---

## 3. Pathogenic Criteria Specifications

### PVS1 - Null Variant

| Strength | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **Not Applicable** | Does not apply given gain-of-function disease mechanism |

---

### PS1 - Same Amino Acid Change

**Original ACMG Summary:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.

#### PS1 (Strong) - 4 points
- Use for missense variants when other variant was classified as **Pathogenic** for autosomal dominant PIK3CD gain-of-function-related disease by Antibody Deficiencies VCEP specifications without using PS1
- Neither change should be predicted to affect splicing (SpliceAI Δ score <0.2)

#### PS1_Moderate - 2 points
- Use for missense variants when other variant was classified as **Likely Pathogenic** for autosomal dominant PIK3CD gain-of-function-related disease by Antibody Deficiencies VCEP specifications without using PS1
- Neither change should be predicted to affect splicing (SpliceAI Δ score <0.2)

---

### PS2 - De Novo Occurrence

**Original ACMG Summary:** De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history.

**VCEP Modification:** This code has been adapted to also reward de novo occurrences in cases where maternity and paternity are suspected but not confirmed (PM6 code is not in use).

#### PS2_VeryStrong - 8 points
- Use when there are **≥4 de novo occurrences** according to Table 2
- Can only be applied if the variant does not meet BA1 or BS1

#### PS2 (Strong) - 4 points
- Use when there are **2-3 de novo occurrences** according to Table 2
- Can only be applied if the variant does not meet BA1 or BS1

#### PS2_Moderate - 2 points
- Use when there is **1 de novo occurrence** according to Table 2
- Can only be applied if the variant does not meet BA1 or BS1

#### PS2_Supporting - 1 point
- Use when there is **1 de novo occurrence** with lower phenotypic consistency
- Can only be applied if the variant does not meet BA1 or BS1

**Phenotypic Consistency Determination:**
1. If proband scores ≥4 and <6 phenotype points but lacks PIK3R1 genotyping → "Phenotype consistent with gene but not highly specific and high genetic heterogeneity"
2. If proband scores ≥6 phenotype points but lacks PIK3R1 genotyping → "Phenotype consistent with gene but not highly specific"
3. If proband scores ≥10 phenotype points AND has PIK3R1 genotyping → "Phenotype highly specific for gene"

---

### PS3 - Functional Studies

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product.

#### PS3 (Strong) - 4 points
Apply for:
- Evidence from an **animal model** expressing the variant and recapitulating the APDS phenotype

#### PS3_Moderate - 2 points
- Abnormal result in approved in vitro assay with minimum of 11 total pathogenic and benign variant controls

| Conformational dynamics | PMID: 28167755, 28414062 |

> **Note:** Protein binding assays testing PIK3CD binding to PIK3R1 were excluded based on lack of evidence of altered binding by disease-associated variants. Patient cell-based functional assays are considered under PP4_Moderate instead.

---

### PS4 - Prevalence in Affected Individuals

**Original ACMG Summary:** The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls.

**Requirements for counting probands:**
- Proband must reach ≥6 points in phenotype scoring criteria (Table 3)
- At minimum, a primary immunodeficiency or antibody gene testing panel must have identified no LP/P variants in PIK3R1
- If no gene panel was performed, ≥10 phenotype points required
- Variant must not meet BS1 or BA1

#### PS4 (Strong) - 4 points
- **≥4 probands** meeting phenotype and genetic testing requirements

#### PS4_Moderate - 2 points

## Document corrections (2026-08-17)

- Re-checked the complete seven-file package source-first, including every image-only scoring table, the pilot workbook, and the SVI-review/update Word document.
- Verified the phenotype rubric and kept the different PS2/PP4 and PS4 roles of phenotype points distinct; the de novo table's low-specificity contribution remains capped at one point.
- Treated `Summary_of_PIK3CD_updates.docx` as review history with panel responses, not as an independent replacement specification, and treated the pilot workbook as validation output.
- Preserved the point-system endpoints and the package's gain-of-function scope exclusions without importing loss-of-function or recessive criteria.
