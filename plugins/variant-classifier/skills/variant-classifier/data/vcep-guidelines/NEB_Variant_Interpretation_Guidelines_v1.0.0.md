## Pathogenic Criteria

### PVS1 - Null Variant

**Original ACMG Summary:** Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical +/-1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease.

Caveats:
- Beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g. GFAP, MYH7).
- Use caution interpreting LOF variants at the extreme 3' end of a gene.
- Use caution with splice variants that are predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the protein intact.
- Use caution in the presence of multiple transcripts.

**VCEP Specifications:** See PVS1 flowchart (Appendix A). Specified critical regions in NEB that should also receive PVS1 are listed below and in the PVS1 flowchart.

**Gene-Specific Notes:**
- In-frame deletions due to the repetitive nature of NEB, particularly in exon 55, are deleterious and pathogenic (Anderson 2004 PMID:15221447, Lehtokari 2009 PMID:19232495).
- Exons 161-183 are critical functional regions (Pelin 1999 PMID:10051637).
- The flowchart prints `(c.25354, p.8452)` beneath “Predicted to undergo NMD” with an undefined superscript `b`; it does not state a comparison operator or direction.
- In-frame exons: 3-180, 182.
- Biologically-relevant transcripts: NM_001164508.2, NM_001164507.2.

> **Unresolved source conflict:** The core PDF places the same statement about deleterious in-frame NEB deletions, particularly exon 55, in both the PVS1 Very Strong and PVS1 Strong blocks. The flowchart routes critical regions (exons 55 and 161-183) to unmodified PVS1, while PM4 says to use either PVS1_Strong or PM4_Strong for in-frame deletions. These readings are reported without selecting one.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Very Strong** | Core PDF: the generic null-variant description, plus specified critical regions including deleterious in-frame deletions (particularly exon 55) and exons 161-183. Flowchart: NMD-producing null variants only when the exon is present in a biologically relevant transcript; critical altered regions (exons 55, 161-183); and full-gene deletions. See the unresolved conflict above. |
| **Strong** | Core PDF: in-frame deletions due to NEB's repetitive nature, particularly exon 55; most NEB exons are in frame (3-180, 182), so skipping an in-frame exon is PVS1_Strong. Flowchart non-NMD/noncritical path: role unknown, LoF variants not frequent, exon present, and strictly >10% of protein removed. See the unresolved conflict above. |
| **Moderate** | Flowchart non-NMD/noncritical path: role unknown, LoF variants not frequent, exon present, and strictly <10% of protein removed. Initiation-codon variants may also reach PVS1_Moderate as described below. |
| **Supporting** | The core PDF says only “See PVS1 flowchart.” The initiation-codon flowchart's lower outcome is printed literally as `PVS1_Supp`; the package does not define or expand that abbreviation. |

> **Unresolved flowchart gaps:** Footnote markers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not defined in the slide or its speaker notes. Every protein-removal branch uses strict `>10%` and `<10%`; exactly 10% has no path.

#### PVS1 Decision Tree Summary

**Nonsense or Frameshift:**
- Predicted to undergo NMD (flowchart prints `(c.25354, p.8452)` with undefined marker `b`) AND exon present in biologically-relevant transcript(s) → **PVS1**
- Predicted to undergo NMD AND exon absent from biologically-relevant transcript(s) → **N/A**
- Not predicted to undergo NMD:
  - Truncated region critical (exons 55, 161-183) → **PVS1**
  - Region unknown + LoF variants frequent in the general population and/or exon absent from biologically-relevant transcripts → **N/A**
  - Region unknown + LoF variants not frequent AND exon present + removes >10% protein → **PVS1_Strong**
  - Region unknown + LoF variants not frequent AND exon present + removes <10% protein → **PVS1_Moderate**

**Canonical Splice Variants (source text: `GT--AG 1,2 splice sites` with undefined marker `a`):**
- Exon skipping or cryptic splice-site use disrupts reading frame + predicted NMD + exon present in biologically-relevant transcript(s) → **PVS1**
- The same NMD-producing consequence + exon absent from biologically-relevant transcript(s) → **N/A**
- Exon skipping preserves reading frame (in-frame exons: 3-180, 182):
  - Truncated region critical (exons 55, 161-183) → **PVS1**
  - Region unknown + LoF variants frequent and/or exon absent → **N/A**
  - Region unknown + LoF variants not frequent AND exon present + removes >10% protein → **PVS1_Strong**
  - Region unknown + LoF variants not frequent AND exon present + removes <10% protein → **PVS1_Moderate**
- Exon skipping or cryptic splice-site use disrupts the frame + is NOT predicted to undergo NMD: the same complete critical-region, frequency, exon-presence, and strict-percentage logic applies

**Deletions (single exon to full gene):**
- Full gene deletion → **PVS1** with undefined marker `d`
- Disrupts reading frame + NMD predicted + exon present in biologically-relevant transcript(s) → **PVS1**
- The same NMD-producing deletion + exon absent from biologically-relevant transcript(s) → **N/A**
- Preserves reading frame:
  - Truncated region critical (exons 55, 161-183) → **PVS1**
  - Region unknown + LoF variants frequent and/or exon absent → **N/A**
  - Region unknown + LoF variants not frequent AND exon present + removes >10% protein → **PVS1_Strong**
  - Region unknown + LoF variants not frequent AND exon present + removes <10% protein → **PVS1_Moderate**
- Disrupts frame + NOT predicted NMD: the same complete critical-region, frequency, exon-presence, and strict-percentage logic applies

**Duplications (>=1 exon, completely within gene):**
- Proven in tandem + reading frame disrupted + NMD predicted → **PVS1**
- Proven in tandem + no or unknown impact on reading frame and NMD → **N/A**
- Presumed in tandem + reading frame presumed disrupted + NMD predicted → **PVS1_Strong**
- Presumed in tandem + no or unknown impact on reading frame and NMD → **N/A**
- Proven not in tandem → **N/A**

**Initiation Codon:**
- Different functional transcript uses alternative start codon → **N/A**
- No known alternative start codon:
  - >=1 pathogenic variant(s) upstream of closest potential in-frame start codon → **PVS1_Moderate**
  - No pathogenic variant(s) upstream → **`PVS1_Supp`** (literal, undefined flowchart abbreviation)

### PS1 - Same Amino Acid Change

**Original ACMG Summary:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change. Example: Val->Leu caused by either G>C or G>T in the same codon. Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:** No change from original ACMG guidelines.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change. Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level. |
| **Moderate** | No change - use as originally described |
| **Supporting** | No change - use as originally described |

---

### PS2 - De Novo (Confirmed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history. Note: Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, etc. can contribute to non-maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** No change from original ACMG guidelines.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history. |
| **Moderate** | No change - use as originally described |
| **Supporting** | No change - use as originally described |

---

### PS3 - Functional Studies

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product. Note: Functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well-established.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Strong may only be considered for variant-specific mouse models. Currently, no other assays are applicable at this strength. *(Modification: Disease-specific)* |
| **Moderate** | The two assays from PS3_Supporting may be stacked to reach Moderate strength. *(Modification: Gene-specific)* |
| **Supporting** | Two specific assays are currently suggested to be applied at Supporting: (1) **Thin filament structure** - an abnormal readout consists of a significant difference in intensity reflections of X-ray diffraction patterns generated by muscle fibers from patient biopsies compared to WT; (2) **In vitro motility** - an abnormal readout consists of a significant difference in speed of single fibers derived from patient muscle compared to WT. If not listed above, it is acceptable to use PS3_Supporting for other functional analyses if: the assay has been validated by a known pathogenic and benign variant AND there is plausible reason that the function the assay is testing relates to the phenotype AND the assay conditions are likely to mimic the physiological environment. *(Modification: Gene-specific)* |

| **PMID** | 32483185 |
| **Author** | Lindqvist...Granzier (2020) |
| **DOI** | Workbook cell is written literally as `DOI: 10.1038/s41467-020-16526-9` |

> **Source-level assay caveats:** The core PDF permits PS3_Strong only for variant-specific mouse models, but the distributed workbook explicitly proposes Supporting for the mouse-model instance above; do not promote it. The workbook's exon-55 deletion coordinates in the assay note (`c.7431+1916_7536+372del`) differ from the core PDF's BA1 exclusion (`NM_001271208.2:c.7431+1919_7536+374del`); the package does not reconcile them.

### PS4 - Prevalence in Affected

**Original ACMG Summary:** The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls. Note 1: Relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR), as obtained from case-control studies, is >5.0 and the confidence interval around the estimate of RR or OR does not include 1.0. Note 2: In instances of very rare variants where case-control studies may not reach statistical significance, the prior observation of the variant in multiple unrelated patients with the same phenotype, and its absence in controls, may be used as moderate level of evidence.

**VCEP Specifications:** NEB is associated with Autosomal Recessive disease; PS4 can only be used for case-control studies and not proband counting. Please use PM3 for individual case observations.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Case-control studies only. RR or OR >5.0, CI does not include 1.0. Not for proband counting - use PM3 instead. *(Modification: Disease-specific, Gene-specific)* |
| **Moderate** | Same restriction - case-control studies only, not proband counting. Use PM3 for individual cases. *(Modification: Gene-specific)* |
| **Supporting** | Same restriction - case-control studies only, not proband counting. Use PM3 for individual cases. *(Modification: Gene-specific)* |

---

### PM1 - Mutational Hot Spot

**Original ACMG Summary:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation.

**VCEP Specifications:** ***Not Applicable***

> There are no defined hotspots or critical functional domains in NEB at this time.

---

### PM2 - Absent from Controls

**Original ACMG Summary:** Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium. Caveat: Population data for indels may be poorly called by next generation sequencing.

**VCEP Specification (Supporting only):**
- PM2_Supporting may be applied if the minor allele frequency in population databases of at least 2,000 alleles is **<=0.0000559**
- 1 allele is allowed

*(Modification: Disease-specific, Gene-specific)*

---

### PM3 - In Trans with Pathogenic

**Original ACMG Summary:** For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant. Note: This requires testing of parents (or offspring) to determine phase.

**VCEP Specifications:** Please use the SVI-recommended PM3 chart to count observations. Points for each proband should be summed to get to a final PM3 strength. The core PDF says, with a preserved duplication, “In order to count to count case counts for your variant of interest, it should be rare enough to not meet BS1.”

> **Distributed-package limitation:** The core PDF links to an external SVI PM3 recommendation but does not reproduce the per-proband chart, and no PM3 chart is distributed with GN146. Per-proband values are therefore not specified by the distributed VCEP package. Do not substitute a generic table.

#### PM3 Evidence Strength Thresholds

| Total Points | Strength Level |
|--------------|----------------|
| 0.5 | PM3_Supporting |
| 1.0 | PM3 (Moderate) |
| 2.0 | PM3_Strong |
| 4.0 | PM3_VeryStrong |

The source states these as four bare exact point values, not `>=` thresholds, and does not state how intermediate totals should be handled.

*(Modification: Disease-specific)*

---

### PM4 - Protein Length Changes

**Original ACMG Summary:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

**VCEP Specifications:** Either PVS1_Strong or PM4_Strong, but not both, should be used for in-frame deletions in NEB.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | In-frame deletions due to the repetitive nature of NEB, particularly in exon 55, are deleterious and pathogenic (Anderson 2004 PMID:15221447, Lehtokari 2009 PMID:19232495). *(Modification: Gene-specific)* |
| **Moderate** | Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants. No change from original. |
| **Supporting** | No change - use as originally described |

> **Important:** Either PVS1_Strong or PM4_Strong should be applied for in-frame deletions in NEB, but not both simultaneously.

---

### PM5 - Novel Missense at Same Residue

**Original ACMG Summary:** Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before. Example: Arg156His is pathogenic; now you observe Arg156Cys. Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:** No change from original ACMG guidelines.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | No change - use as originally described |
| **Moderate** | Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different pathogenic missense change has been seen before. Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing. |
| **Supporting** | No change - use as originally described |

---

### PM6 - De Novo (Assumed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** No change from original ACMG guidelines.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | No change - use as originally described |
| **Moderate** | No change - use as originally described |
| **Supporting** | No change - use as originally described |

---

### PP1 - Co-segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease. Note: May be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data.

**VCEP Specifications:** The segregation chart (adopted from Oza et al 2018 PMID:30311386) should be used to determine the strength level of the total number of affected and unaffected segregations. In order to count unaffected segregations, the unaffected individuals can be heterozygous carriers or WT, but should have the same risk of inheriting the variant as the affected individuals (e.g. siblings in the same generation).

#### PP1 General Thresholds

| | Supporting | Moderate | Strong |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Likelihood** | 4:1 | 16:1 | 32:1 |
| **LOD Score** | 0.6 | 1.2 | 1.5 |
| **Autosomal dominant threshold** | 2 affected segregations | 4 affected segregations | 5 affected segregations |
| **Autosomal recessive threshold** | See Table 5 | See Table 5 | See Table 5 |

> **Distributed-package limitation:** `Segregation chart.pdf` does not contain Table 5, and no Table 5 is otherwise distributed with GN146. The autosomal-recessive threshold row is therefore unresolved. The legend gives bare LOD values (0.6, 1.2, 1.5) without comparison operators.

#### Segregation Table for Autosomal Recessive (LOD Scores)

*General recommendations (phenocopy not an issue). Rows = affected segregations, Columns = unaffected recessive segregations.*

| Affected \ Unaffected | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |

### PP2 - Missense in Constrained Gene

**Original ACMG Summary:** Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.

**VCEP Specifications:** ***Not Applicable***

> NEB is not a gene that is constrained for missense variation. Hence PP2 is not applicable.

---

### PP3 - Computational Evidence

**Original ACMG Summary:** Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.). Caveat: As many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion. PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.

**VCEP Specifications (Supporting only):**

PP3 is met if:
- **REVEL score >=0.7**, OR
- The variant is predicted to impact splicing using **SpliceAI score >=0.5**

*(Modification: General recommendation)*

---

### PP4 - Phenotype Specificity

**Original ACMG Summary:** Patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

**VCEP Specifications (Supporting):**

PP4 is met with the presence of any of these features:

**Presence on Muscle Biopsy of:**
- Nemaline rods
- Shorter thin filaments

**Functional assays performed upon patient muscle biopsy indicate:**
- Significantly altered calcium sensitivity
- Significantly altered muscle mechanics (altered force-sarcomere length or reduced contractile strength and force generation)

*(Modification: Disease-specific, Gene-specific)*

---

### PP5 - Reputable Source

**Original ACMG Summary:** Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation.

**VCEP Specifications:** ***Not Applicable***

> This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee (PMID: 29543229).

---

## Benign Criteria

### BA1 - Allele Frequency >5%

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is above 5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

**VCEP Specification (Stand Alone):**
- The minor allele frequency using the filtering allele frequency of either exomes or genomes in gnomAD is **>=0.00559**
- All populations used should have at least 2,000 alleles and >1 observation
- The Ashkenazi Jewish, European Finnish, and Other populations in gnomAD will **not** be used for BA1 application

**BA1 Exclusion Variants** (well-known pathogenic variants that are above the specified BA1 threshold):
1. Exon 55 deletion common in the AJ population (NM_001271208.2:c.7431+1919_7536+374del)
2. NM_001271208.2:c.19097G>T (p.Ser6366Ile)
3. NM_001271208.2:c.22249A>C (p.Thr7417Pro)

*(Modification: Disease-specific, Gene-specific)*

---

### BS1 - Frequency Greater Than Expected

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.

**VCEP Specification (Strong):**
- The minor allele frequency using the filtering allele frequency of either exomes or genomes in gnomAD is **>=0.000237** in continental populations
- All populations used should have at least 2,000 alleles and >1 observation

*(Modification: Disease-specific, Gene-specific)*

---

### BS2 - Observed in Healthy Adult

**Original ACMG Summary:** Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.

**VCEP Specifications:** No change from original ACMG guidelines.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age. |
| **Moderate** | No change - use as originally described |
| **Supporting** | No change - use as originally described |

---

### BS3 - Functional Studies (No Effect)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | The two assays from BS3_Supporting may be stacked to reach Moderate strength. *(Modification: Gene-specific)* |
| **Supporting** | Two specific assays are currently suggested to be applied at Supporting: (1) **Thin filament structure** - a normal readout consists of no significant difference in intensity reflections of X-ray diffraction patterns generated by muscle fibers from patient biopsies compared to WT; (2) **In vitro motility** - the source says a normal readout consists of “no a significant difference” [sic] in speed of single fibers derived from patient muscle compared to WT. *(Modification: Gene-specific)* |

---

### BS4 - Lack of Segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family. Caveat: The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e. cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.

**VCEP Specifications:** No change from original ACMG guidelines.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Lack of segregation in affected members of a family. Caveat applies regarding phenocopies. |
| **Moderate** | No change - use as originally described |
| **Supporting** | No change - use as originally described |

---

### BP1-BP7 - Benign Supporting

| Criterion | Status | Comment |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **BP1** | *Not Applicable* | Both missense and truncating variants in NEB are disease-causing. |
| **BP2** | Applicable (no change) | Observed in trans with a pathogenic variant for a fully penetrant dominant gene/disorder or observed in cis with a pathogenic variant in any inheritance pattern. Available at Supporting, Moderate, and Strong. |
| **BP3** | *Not Applicable* | There are no regions in NEB where BP3 would apply. |
| **BP4** | Applicable (Supporting) | BP4 is met if the REVEL score <=0.15 or if the variant is not predicted to impact splicing using SpliceAI. *(General recommendation)* |
| **BP5** | Applicable (no change) | Variant found in a case with an alternate molecular basis for disease. Available at Supporting, Moderate, and Strong. |
| **BP6** | *Not Applicable* | This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen SVI VCEP Review Committee (PMID: 29543229). |
| **BP7** | Applicable (Supporting) | A synonymous variant for which SpliceAI predicts no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved. *(General recommendation)* |

### Appendix A: PVS1 Flowchart

The PVS1 decision tree for NEB follows the ClinGen SVI PVS1 flowchart framework with the following NEB-specific annotations:

- **Biologically-relevant transcripts:** NM_001164508.2, NM_001164507.2
- **NMD label:** the source prints `(c.25354, p.8452)` with undefined marker `b`, without a comparator or direction
- **In-frame exons:** 3-180, 182
- **Critical functional regions:** Exons 55, 161-183
- **Undefined source markers:** `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` have no definitions in the slide or speaker notes
- **Percentage gap:** strict `>10%` and `<10%` branches leave exactly 10% unassigned
- **Literal source text retained:** `GT--AG 1,2 splice sites` and initiation output `PVS1_Supp`
- **Key references:**
  - Anderson 2004 (PMID:15221447) - Exon 55 deletion

## Version History

| Version | Date | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 1.0.0 | 8/7/2024 | Initial release of NEB-specific ACMG/AMP criteria specifications by the Congenital Myopathies VCEP |
| 1.0.0 | 2026-08-09 | **Document corrections.** Verified all criteria, combination rules, metadata, DOI, transcript list, frequency comparators, references, and the external-only PM3-chart limitation against `ClinGen_ACMG_Specifications_NEB_v1.0.pdf`; removed the package-absent generic PS2/PM6 point system and PM3 per-proband table, and removed unsupplied bibliographic expansions. Verified every shape, connector, branch and speaker note in `PVS1 decision tree for NEB.pptx`; restored omitted exon-presence gates, full frequency/exon gates, strict percentage logic and deletion/duplication/splice routes, and documented the transcript conflict, undefined `a`-`d` markers, exact-10% gap, literal `GT--AG`/`PVS1_Supp` text, and the unresolved PVS1 strength conflict. Verified every populated cell in both worksheets of `NEB approved functional assays.xlsx`; restored replication, control, validation, statistics, threshold, genotype and assay-method fields, corrected the mouse-model `Variants evaluated` field to blank, and documented its proposed-strength and exon-55-coordinate conflicts. Verified all 121 LOD cells and the legend in `Segregation chart.pdf`; removed invented comparison operators and documented the missing Table 5. No change to the underlying ClinGen specification version. |
