## Gene Information

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Gene** | RYR1 (HGNC:10483) |
| **HGNC Name** | ryanodine receptor 1 |
| **Transcript** | NM_000540.3 |
| **Disease** | RYR1-related myopathy (MONDO:0100150) |
| **Inheritance** | Autosomal recessive inheritance |

> **General Note on Multiple MOIs:** In general, the easiest way to tell whether a variant is AD or AR is to look at the clinical situation of probands with the variant, along with the family and inheritance. If it's de novo, it's much more likely to be AD and if it's observed with a second variant, it's much more likely to be AR. In general, loss of function variants are almost always associated with AR disease. If two missense variants are identified in trans, individuals are much more likely to have central core or minicore disease. Malignant hyperthermia is only associated with AD variants. However, there have been some examples of a missense MH variant in trans with a LOF variant, causing a blended phenotype of myopathy and MH susceptibility. The AD and AR specifications are listed separately.

> **Release Notes (v2.0.0):** The approved BS1 threshold for AR variant curation was listed incorrectly and has been corrected in this release.

## Pathogenic Criteria

### PVS1 - Null Variant

**Original ACMG Summary:** Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical +/-1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease.

Caveats:
- Beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g. GFAP, MYH7).
- Use caution interpreting LOF variants at the extreme 3' end of a gene.
- Use caution with splice variants that are predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the protein intact.
- Use caution in the presence of multiple transcripts.

**VCEP Specifications:**

RYR1 is associated with both dominant and recessive myopathy. Loss of function is only a mechanism for autosomal recessive (AR) disease and **PVS1 should only be applied for AR variants**.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Very Strong (PVS1)** | Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical +/-1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) where LOF is a known mechanism — apply per the distributed PVS1 flowchart. |
| **Strong (PVS1_Strong)** | In-frame deletions or in-frame exon-skipping variants in the pore/transmembrane region of RYR1 (amino acids 4800-4950, exons 100-103). Also applies to other scenarios per the PVS1 flowchart. |
| **Moderate (PVS1_Moderate)** | See PVS1 flowchart (Appendix A). |
| **Supporting (PVS1_Supporting)** | See PVS1 flowchart (Appendix A). |

> **Modification Type:** Disease-specific, Gene-specific

---

### PS1 - Same Amino Acid Change

**Original ACMG Summary:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change. Example: Val->Leu caused by either G>C or G>T in the same codon. Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | No change — use as originally described. |
| **Moderate** | No change — use as originally described. |
| **Supporting** | No change — use as originally described. |

> **Modification Type:** No change

---

### PS2 - De Novo (Confirmed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history. Note: Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, etc. can contribute to non-maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** No change — use as originally described at all strength levels (Very Strong, Strong, Moderate, Supporting).

The GN179 package supplies no PS2/PM6 point-system attachment or thresholds. No point system is inferred from generic SVI material.

> **Modification Type:** No change

---

### PS3 - Functional Studies

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product. Note: Functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well-established.

**VCEP Specifications:**

Specified assays are only provided for the AD specifications, which are listed separately. For AR RYR1-related myopathy:

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | May only be considered for **variant-specific mouse models**. Currently, no other assays are applicable at this strength. |
| **Moderate** | Not specified for AR. |
| **Supporting** | There are no specified functional assays for AR RYR1-related myopathy. However, it is acceptable to use PS3_Supporting for other functional analyses if: (1) The assay has been validated by a known pathogenic and benign variant, AND (2) There is plausible reason that the function the assay is testing relates to the phenotype, AND (3) The assay conditions are likely to mimic the physiological environment. |

> **Modification Type:** Disease-specific, Gene-specific

---

### PS4 - Prevalence in Affected

**Original ACMG Summary:** The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls.

**VCEP Specifications:** **Not Applicable** for autosomal recessive RYR1 variants. Please use **PM3** for case counting. There are separate specifications for AD RYR1 variants.

> **Modification Type:** Disease-specific, Gene-specific

---

### PM1 - Mutational Hot Spot

**Original ACMG Summary:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | The pore/transmembrane region of RYR1 is critical for protein function and missense variants that fall within this region (**amino acids 4800-4950**). |

The source gives only the range notation `4800-4950`; endpoint comparator symbols are not stated separately.

> **Modification Type:** Disease-specific, Gene-specific

---

### PM2 - Absent from Controls

**Original ACMG Summary:** Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in population databases. Caveat: Population data for indels may be poorly called by next generation sequencing.

**VCEP Specifications:**

If the mode of inheritance for the variant is unclear (largely with missense variants as loss of function variants are predicted to cause AR disease), use the more conservative AD cutoff and specifications for PM2_Supporting.

**PM2_Supporting (Supporting only):**
- Minor allele frequency in population databases of at least 2,000 alleles is **≤0.00000697** for autosomal recessive

> **Modification Type:** Disease-specific, Gene-specific

---

### PM3 - In Trans with Pathogenic

**Original ACMG Summary:** For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant. Note: This requires testing of parents (or offspring) to determine phase.

**VCEP Specifications:**

Use the SVI-recommended PM3 chart to count observations. Points for each proband should be summed to get to a final PM3 strength. In order to count case counts for your variant of interest, it should be **rare enough to not meet BS1**.

> **Source typo:** The core PDF begins the last instruction `In order to count to count case counts`; the duplicated words have no alternate operational meaning.

#### PM3 Point System (Per Proband)

| Classification/Zygosity of Other Variant | Known in Trans | Phase unknown |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Likely Pathogenic / Pathogenic | 1.0 | 0.5 |
| Homozygous occurrence (`max point 1.0`) or Rare VUS on other allele | 0.5 | N/A |

#### PM3 Evidence Strength Thresholds

| Total Points | Strength Level |
|--------------|----------------|
| 0.5 | PM3_Supporting |
| 1.0 | PM3 (Moderate) |
| 2.0 | PM3_Strong |
| 4.0 | PM3_VeryStrong |

The core PDF and `PM3 chart.docx` print these as bare point values, not `>=` thresholds or ranges. The package does not specify how intermediate totals or totals above 4.0 map to strength.

> **Modification Type:** Disease-specific, Gene-specific

---

### PM4 - Protein Length Changes

**Original ACMG Summary:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

**VCEP Specifications:**

Either **PVS1_Strong** or **PM4_Strong**, but not both, should be used for in-frame deletions in the pore region (amino acids 4800-4950) of RYR1.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | No change — use as originally described. |
| **Moderate** | Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants. |
| **Supporting** | No change — use as originally described. |

> **Note:** For in-frame deletions in the pore/transmembrane region (AAs 4800-4950), choose either PVS1_Strong or PM4_Strong, not both.

> **Modification Type:** No change (with gene-specific caveat for pore region)

---

### PM5 - Novel Missense at Same Residue

**Original ACMG Summary:** Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before. Example: Arg156His is pathogenic; now you observe Arg156Cys. Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | No change — use as originally described. |
| **Moderate** | No change — use as originally described. |
| **Supporting** | No change — use as originally described. |

> **Modification Type:** No change

---

### PM6 - De Novo (Assumed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** No change — use as originally described. The GN179 package supplies no PM6 point system.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | No change — use as originally described. |
| **Moderate** | No change — use as originally described. |
| **Supporting** | No change — use as originally described. |

> **Modification Type:** No change

---

### PP1 - Co-segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease. Note: May be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data.

**VCEP Specifications:**

The segregation chart (adopted from Oza et al 2018, PMID:30311386) should be used to determine the strength level of the total number of affected and unaffected segregations. In order to count unaffected segregations, the unaffected individuals can be heterozygous carriers or WT, but should have the same risk of inheriting the variant as the affected individuals (e.g. siblings in the same generation).

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | See segregation chart (Oza et al 2018, PMID:30311386) |
| **Moderate** | See segregation chart |
| **Supporting** | See segregation chart |

> **Unavailable distributed source:** No segregation-chart artifact is present in the GN179 package or listed under the core PDF's Files & Images. The distributed specification therefore supplies no PP1 thresholds or matrix. Do not substitute a generic Oza et al. grid.

> **Modification Type:** General recommendation

---

### PP2 - Missense in Constrained Gene

**Original ACMG Summary:** Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.

**VCEP Specifications:** **Not Applicable.** RYR1 is not a gene that is constrained for missense variation. Hence PP2 is not applicable.

---

### PP3 - Computational Evidence

**Original ACMG Summary:** Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.). Caveat: As many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion. PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.

**VCEP Specifications (Supporting):**

PP3 is met if:
- **REVEL score ≥ 0.7**, OR
- The variant is predicted to impact splicing using **SpliceAI score ≥ 0.5**

> **Modification Type:** General recommendation

---

### PP4 - Phenotype Specificity

**Original ACMG Summary:** Patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

**VCEP Specifications (Supporting):**

To meet PP4, a congenital myopathy testing panel should be performed without identification of other causative variants **AND AT LEAST TWO** of these features should be present:

1. Presence on muscle biopsy of: **mini cores or central cores** (histology or electron microscopy)
2. **Exercise, heat, or anesthetic induced rhabdomyolysis**
3. **Ophthalmoplegia**
4. **Characteristic muscle imaging** (see Figure 8, Saade et al 2019, PMID:31060725)

> **Modification Type:** Disease-specific, Gene-specific

---

### PP5 - Reputable Source

**Original ACMG Summary:** Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation.

**VCEP Specifications:** **Not Applicable.** This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee (PMID:29543229).

---

## Benign Criteria

### BA1 - Allele Frequency >5%

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is above 5% in population databases.

**VCEP Specification (Stand Alone):**

- The minor allele frequency using the filtering allele frequency of either exomes or genomes of continental populations in gnomAD is **≥0.00697** for AR variants
- All populations used should have at least **2,000 alleles** and **>1 observation**

If the mode of inheritance for the variant is unclear (this largely applies to missense variants as loss of function variants are suspected to cause AR disease), use the more conservative AR cutoff and specifications for BA1.

**BA1 Exclusion Variants** (well-known pathogenic variants that are above the specified BA1 or BS1 threshold):
- NM_000540.3:c.6721C>T (p.Arg2241Ter)
- NM_000540.3:c.10348-6C>G

> **Modification Type:** Disease-specific, Gene-specific

---

### BS1 - Frequency Greater Than Expected

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.

**VCEP Specification (Strong):**

- The minor allele frequency using the filtering allele frequency of either exomes or genomes of continental populations in gnomAD is **≥0.000697** for AR variants
- All populations used should have at least **2,000 alleles** and **>1 observation**

If the mode of inheritance for the variant is unclear (this largely applies to missense variants as loss of function variants are suspected to cause AR disease), use the more conservative AR cutoff and specifications for BS1.

**BA1/BS1 Exclusion Variants:**
- NM_000540.3:c.6721C>T (p.Arg2241Ter)
- NM_000540.3:c.10348-6C>G

> **Modification Type:** Disease-specific, Gene-specific

---

### BS2 - Observed in Healthy Adult

**Original ACMG Summary:** Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | No change — use as originally described. |
| **Moderate** | No change — use as originally described. |
| **Supporting** | No change — use as originally described. |

> **Modification Type:** No change

---

### BS3 - Functional Studies (No Effect)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.

**VCEP Specifications:** **Not Applicable.** The VCEP has decided that lack of demonstrated effect in a functional assay should not count against the pathogenicity of an RYR1 variant because of the numerous possible functions of the ryanodine receptor; therefore all specified functional assays will only be used as evidence for pathogenicity.

---

### BS4 - Lack of Segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family. Caveat: The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e. cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | No change — use as originally described. |
| **Moderate** | No change — use as originally described. |
| **Supporting** | No change — use as originally described. |

> **Modification Type:** No change

---

### BP1-BP7 - Benign Supporting

| Criterion | Status | Comment |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **BP1** | **Not Applicable** | Both missense and truncating variants in RYR1 are disease-causing. |
| **BP2** | Applicable (no change) | Strong/Moderate: `No change - use as originally described`, with no separate definition. Supporting: observed in trans with a pathogenic variant for a fully penetrant dominant gene/disorder or observed in cis with a pathogenic variant in any inheritance pattern. |
| **BP3** | **Not Applicable** | There are no regions in RYR1 where BP3 would apply. |
| **BP4** | Applicable (modified) | BP4 is met if **REVEL score ≤ 0.15** or if the variant is **not predicted to impact splicing using SpliceAI**. |
| **BP5** | Applicable (no change) | Strong/Moderate: `No change - use as originally described`, with no separate definition. Supporting: variant found in a case with an alternate molecular basis for disease. |
| **BP6** | **Not Applicable** | This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen SVI VCEP Review Committee (PMID:29543229). |
| **BP7** | Applicable (modified) | A synonymous variant for which **SpliceAI** predicts no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved. |

## Appendices

### Appendix A: PVS1 Decision Tree for RYR1

The following flowchart describes PVS1 strength assignment for different variant types in RYR1:

**Source caveats:** Footnote markers `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` are printed but never defined in the slide or speaker notes. Every protein-removal decision uses strict `>10%` and `<10%`, leaving exactly 10% unassigned. The slide spells the initiation-codon Supporting outcome `PVS1_Supp`; that label is preserved rather than expanded by inference. Speaker notes contain only the template instructions `PLEASE NOTE – highlighted areas are where the VCEP should provide guidance for each gene under specification.` and `Weights may be adjusted if appropriate (e.g start codon)`.

**Raw-OOXML caveat:** The slide contains 86 text shapes and 83 connectors. Connector 181 has a start binding but no end binding, while connectors 218 and 219 have end bindings but no start bindings. The rendered deletion arrows are nevertheless visually continuous from `Role of region in protein function is unknown` to the two LoF-frequency boxes. The topology below follows the visible rendered arrows while preserving this raw connector defect.
