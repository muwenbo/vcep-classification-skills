## Pathogenic Criteria

### PVS1 - Null Variant

**Original ACMG Summary:** Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical +/-1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease.

**Caveats:**
- Beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g. GFAP, MYH7).
- Use caution interpreting LOF variants at the extreme 3' end of a gene.
- Use caution with splice variants that are predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the protein intact.
- Use caution in the presence of multiple transcripts.

**VCEP Specifications:**

Please see the SGCG PVS1 flowchart (Appendix A). In addition, for any variant with RNA/splicing data, follow the SVI Working Group's recommendations (Walker et al. 2023; PMID: 37352859). See the experimental splice data flowchart (Appendix B).

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Default Points | Criteria |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Very Strong** | 8 | Follow the SGCG PVS1 decision tree. For any variant with RNA/splicing data, follow Walker et al. 2023 (PMID: 37352859). |
| **Strong** | 4 | Follow the SGCG PVS1 decision tree. For any variant with RNA/splicing data, follow Walker et al. 2023 (PMID: 37352859). |
| **Moderate** | 2 | Follow the SGCG PVS1 decision tree. For any variant with RNA/splicing data, follow Walker et al. 2023 (PMID: 37352859). |
| **Supporting** | 1 | Follow the SGCG PVS1 decision tree. For any variant with RNA/splicing data, follow Walker et al. 2023 (PMID: 37352859). |

#### PVS1 Decision Tree Summary for SGCG

**Nonsense or Frameshift:**
- Predicted to undergo NMD (premature truncation in codons 35-216): exon present in NM_000231.3 -> **PVS1**; exon absent -> **N/A**
- Premature truncation within the first 100 bp (codons 1-34) (PMID: 27618451): **PVS1_Moderate**
- Not predicted to undergo NMD:
  - Role of region in protein function is unknown:
    - LoF variants in this exon are frequent in the general population and/or exon is absent from biologically relevant transcript(s): **N/A**
    - LoF variants in this exon are NOT frequent and exon is present in NM_000231.3:
      - Variant removes >10% of protein: **PVS1_Strong**
      - Variant removes <10% of protein: **PVS1_Moderate**

**Canonical GT-AG +/-1,2 Splice Sites:**
- Use SpliceAI prediction of the most likely splice effect and determine the expected protein consequence (https://spliceailookup.broadinstitute.org)
- Exon skipping or use of cryptic splice site **disrupts reading frame and is predicted to undergo NMD**: exon present in NM_000231.3 -> **PVS1**; exon absent -> **N/A**
- Exon skipping or use of cryptic splice site **preserves reading frame**:
  - In-frame exons for which exon skipping is not expected to result in NMD: **2, 3, 5, 8**
  - Role of region in protein function is unknown:
    - LoF variants in this exon are frequent in general population and/or exon is absent: **N/A**
    - LoF variants in this exon are NOT frequent and exon is present in NM_000231.3:
      - Variant removes >10% of protein: **PVS1_Strong**
      - Variant removes <10% of protein: **PVS1_Moderate**
- Exon skipping or use of cryptic splice site **disrupts reading frame and is NOT predicted to undergo NMD**: Same branching as "Not predicted to undergo NMD" above

**Deletion (Single exon to full gene):**
- Single to multi exon deletion - disrupts reading frame and is predicted to undergo NMD: exon present in NM_000231.3 -> **PVS1**; exon absent -> **N/A**
- Single to multi exon deletion - disrupts reading frame and is NOT predicted to undergo NMD: Same branching as frameshift not predicted to undergo NMD
- Single to multi exon deletion - preserves reading frame: Same branching as splice variants that preserve reading frame
- Full gene deletion: **PVS1**

**Duplication (>=1 exon in size, completely contained within gene):**
- Proven in tandem - reading frame disrupted and NMD predicted: **PVS1**
- Proven in tandem - no or unknown impact on reading frame and NMD: **N/A**
- Presumed in tandem - reading frame presumed disrupted and NMD predicted: **PVS1_Strong**
- Proven not in tandem: **N/A**

**Initiation Codon:**
- No known alternative start codon in other transcripts and no pathogenic variant upstream of the closest potential in-frame start codon: **PVS1_Supporting**
- The flowchart visibly strikes through the alternative-functional-transcript -> N/A path and the >=1-upstream-pathogenic-variant -> PVS1_Moderate path. They are not operative specifications.

> **Distributed-source limitations:** The `PVS1 flowchart SGCG.pptx` percentage branches are strict `>10%` and `<10%`, so exactly 10% is unassigned. Its critical-region -> PVS1_Strong branches are visibly struck through and state that no critical region is specified. Superscripts `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` have no definitions in the slide or speaker notes; `d` appears on full-gene-deletion PVS1.

### PS1 - Same Amino Acid Change

**Original ACMG Summary:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change. Example: Val->Leu caused by either G>C or G>T in the same codon.

**Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:**

#### For missense variants (amino acid change is expected mechanism):

| Strength | Default Points | Criteria |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Strong** | 4 | Apply for 1 pathogenic or 2 likely pathogenic variants resulting in the same amino acid change. The LP/P variant(s) must have been classified using LGMD VCEP specifications. Potential splice effects must be excluded for the variant under curation and the comparison variant(s) (SpliceAI score <=0.10 or experimental evidence of normal splicing). |
| **Moderate** | 2 | Apply for 1 likely pathogenic variant resulting in the same amino acid change. The LP variant must have been classified using LGMD VCEP specifications. Potential splice effects must be excluded for both the variant under curation and the comparison variant (SpliceAI score <=0.10 or experimental evidence of normal splicing). |

**Important Notes:**
- PS1 can potentially be applied to multiple nucleotide changes at the same residue as long as the variant classification that determines the strength level does not depend on PS1 application.
- For missense variants encoded by the first or last 3 nucleotides of an exon, PS1 should be considered only in the context of altered splicing (see below), unless a splice effect has been experimentally ruled out for the variant under curation and the variant(s) resulting in the same amino acid change.

#### For variants where nucleotide change is expected mechanism (altered splicing):

Follow SVI Working Group recommendations (Walker et al. 2023; PMID: 37352859), as outlined in the PS1 splicing table (Appendix C).

| Strength | Default Points | Criteria |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Strong** | 4 | Follow SVI Working Group recommendations for splicing variants (Walker et al. 2023; PMID: 37352859) and the PS1 splicing table (Appendix C). |
| **Moderate** | 2 | Follow SVI Working Group recommendations for splicing variants (Walker et al. 2023; PMID: 37352859) and the PS1 splicing table (Appendix C). |
| **Supporting** | 1 | Follow SVI Working Group recommendations for splicing variants (Walker et al. 2023; PMID: 37352859). |

---

### PS2 - De Novo (Confirmed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history.

**Note:** Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, etc. can contribute to non-maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Default Points | Criteria |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Supporting** | 1 | Apply for confirmed *de novo* occurrence in a proband meeting the criteria for PP4 (Supporting). Maternity and paternity should be confirmed by trio WES/WGS or other testing. |

> **Note:** PS2 is only available at Supporting strength for SGCG; PM6 is not applicable and points to PS2.

---

### PS3 - Functional Studies

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product.

**Note:** Functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well-established.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Default Points | Criteria |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Strong** | 4 | Variant-specific animal model meeting ALL of the following conditions (regardless of species): (1) signs of myopathy or dystrophy present in skeletal muscle, (2) effect on gene or protein function demonstrated (e.g., decreased protein expression, impaired membrane localization, or other functional abnormality), (3) behavioral signs of muscle weakness, (4) progression over time. |
| **Moderate** | 2 | Variant-specific animal model meeting: (1) signs of myopathy or dystrophy present in skeletal muscle, AND (2) effect on gene or protein function demonstrated. OR sarcoglycan complex membrane localization assays clinically validated with >=11 control variants meeting criteria specified in Brnich et al. 2020 (PMID: 31892348). |
| **Supporting** | 1 | Variant expressed in heterologous cell lines/model organisms shows absent membrane localization of the sarcoglycan protein complex AND fewer than 11 control variants were used (per Brnich et al. 2020; PMID: 31892348). |

**Important Notes:**
- For any variant type, experimental evidence for altered splicing should be scored under PVS1 in accordance with Walker et al. 2023 (PMID: 37352859), NOT under PS3.
- Apply PS3 only once, for the piece of evidence that meets the highest possible strength level.

#### Approved Assay Instances

| Assay | PMID | Author/Year | Description | Approved? | Strength |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Membrane localization of sarcoglycan complex | 22095924 | Soheili, 2012 | Vectors expressing SGCG variant transfected into HER-911 cells expressing three other sarcoglycans; membrane localization assessed via confocal immunofluorescence of nonpermeabilized cells | Yes | PS3_Supporting; BS3 not applied |

**Assay Details:**

### PS4 - Prevalence in Affected

**Original ACMG Summary:** The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Default Points | Criteria |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Strong** | 4 | Use without disease-specific modification if case-control studies are available. |

> **Note:** While case-control studies could potentially be considered for a few pathogenic variants with high minor allele frequency, the VCEP is unaware of any such studies being conducted for SGCG. Any case-control study would require careful selection of an appropriate control population given the potential for late onset and mild disease.

---

### PM1 - Mutational Hot Spot

**Original ACMG Summary:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation.

**VCEP Specifications:** ***Not Applicable*** - Not applicable at this time.

---

### PM2 - Absent from Controls

**Original ACMG Summary:** Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in population databases.

**Caveat:** Population data for indels may be poorly called by next generation sequencing.

**VCEP Specification (Supporting only):**

| Strength | Default Points | Criteria |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Supporting** | 1 | Apply if the Grpmax variant allele frequency / upper bound of the 95% CI of the Grpmax variant allele frequency in gnomAD is **<0.00009**. |

**Detailed Requirements:**
- Do not use data for which the variant does not pass quality control filters.
- If only 1 or 2 variant alleles are present in the Grpmax population, use the Grpmax variant allele frequency.
- If at least 3 variant alleles are present in the Grpmax population, use the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the Grpmax variant allele frequency.
- **Grpmax** refers to the gnomAD subpopulation with the highest variant allele frequency. Use large, non-bottlenecked genetic ancestry groups; **avoid** using the Amish, Ashkenazi Jewish, European Finnish, and Remaining Individuals groups as well as the genomes-only data for the Middle Eastern group.
- The upper bound of the 95% CI must be calculated using variant allele numbers and counts from gnomAD. Confidence interval tools such as [Confit-de-MAF](https://www.genecalculators.net/confit-de-maf.html) can be used.
- Use the gnomAD version with the largest allele number.
- For larger deletions or duplications that may not be well represented in gnomAD (e.g., single- or multi-exon events), also confirm the variant is not common in gnomAD SVs, gnomAD CNVs, or the [Database of Genomic Variants (DGV)](https://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home).

---

### PM3 - In Trans with Pathogenic

**Original ACMG Summary:** For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant.

**Note:** This requires testing of parents (or offspring) to determine phase.

**VCEP Specifications:** Use the SVI Working Group's recommended point system to determine PM3 strength.

#### PM3 Point System (Per Proband)

| Classification/Zygosity of Other Variant | Confirmed in Trans | Phase Unknown |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Pathogenic or Likely pathogenic variant (classified using LGMD VCEP specs) | 1.0 | 0.5 (P) / 0.25 (LP) |
| Homozygous occurrence (max 1.0 pt; downgrade to 0.25 pts for consanguinity) | 0.5 | N/A |
| Uncertain significance variant (max 0.5 pts total) | 0.25 | 0 |

#### PM3 Evidence Strength Thresholds

| Total Points | Strength Level | Default Points |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| >=0.5 but <1.0 | PM3_Supporting | 1 |
| >=1.0 but <2.0 | PM3 (Moderate) | 2 |
| >=2.0 but <4.0 | PM3_Strong | 4 |
| >=4.0 | PM3_Very Strong | 8 |

#### PM3 Important Notes

1. Author assertions on phase, including based on allele-specific transcript expression, are acceptable.
2. For variants identified in unknown phase, PM3 points should **not** be awarded under the following circumstances:
   - The same variants were ever confirmed in cis (e.g., in a different patient in the literature)
   - gnomAD co-occurrence data (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant-cooccurrence) predict the variants may be part of the same haplotype in at least one genetic ancestry group
   - More than 2 variants are reported in the patient, none of which can be classified as likely benign or benign
3. Any variant awarded points as likely pathogenic or pathogenic must have been classified using the LGMD VCEP specifications.
4. For any variant awarded points as VUS, benign frequency codes (BA1, BS1) cannot be applicable.

#### PM3 Co-Application Rules

It is possible to award PM3 points to both variants identified in an individual as long as the evidence related to their co-observation in that individual does not contribute to the variant classification that determines the number of points applied. This excludes all evidence derived from the co-observation, including:
- Inter-dependent PM3 points (pathogenicity of variant in trans/unknown phase)
- PP1 (genotype-phenotype co-segregation)
- PP4 (phenotype specificity)

**Example 1 - PM3 can be awarded to both variants without circularity:**

Variants A and B are observed in trans in patient X, who meets criteria for PP4. Variant A is classified as LP independent of the observation in patient X (e.g., PVS1 + PM2_Supporting). Variant B is also classified as LP independent of patient X (e.g., PS3_Moderate + PP3 + PM2_Supporting + PP4_Moderate for patient Y + PM3 for variant C in patient Y). In this case, 1.0 PM3 pt can be awarded to each variant for the observation in patient X, since each was independently classified as LP without counting the co-observation evidence.

**Example 2 - PM3 cannot be awarded to both variants without circularity:**

Variants A and B are observed in trans in patient X. Variant A is classified as LP independent of patient X (PVS1 + PM2_Supporting). Variant B is classified as VUS independent of patient X (PS3_Moderate + PP3 + PM2_Supporting + PP4 for patient Y). In this case, PM3 can be awarded to variant B (confirmed in trans with LP variant A = 1.0 pt), but PM3 cannot be awarded to variant A because variant B was VUS independent of patient X (only 0.25 pts for VUS, insufficient to apply PM3).

---

### PM4 - Protein Length Changes

**Original ACMG Summary:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Default Points | Criteria |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Moderate** | 2 | Use as is, regardless of the length of the in-frame insertion or deletion. |

---

### PM5 - Novel Missense at Same Residue

**Original ACMG Summary:** Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before. Example: Arg156His is pathogenic; now you observe Arg156Cys.

**Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:**

Apply only for missense variants for which the amino acid change is the expected mechanism of disease.

| Strength | Default Points | Criteria |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Strong** | 4 | 2 pathogenic or 3 likely pathogenic variants resulting in different amino acid changes at the same residue as the variant under curation. |
| **Moderate** | 2 | 1 pathogenic or 2 likely pathogenic variants resulting in different amino acid changes at the same residue as the variant under curation. |
| **Supporting** | 1 | 1 likely pathogenic variant resulting in a different amino acid change at the same residue as the variant under curation. |

**Requirements for all PM5 strength levels:**
- For the missense variant under curation and the variant(s) resulting in a different amino acid change, exclude likely splice effects (SpliceAI score <0.5 or experimental evidence of normal splicing).
- The REVEL score for the missense variant under curation should be >0.7.
- Missense changes at the same residue must be classified according to LGMD VCEP specifications.
- No benign missense variation should be present at the residue.
- Do not apply for missense variants encoded by the first or last 3 nucleotides of an exon unless a splice effect has been ruled out for the variant under curation and the variant(s) resulting in the same amino acid change.
- PM5 can potentially be applied to multiple amino acid changes at the same residue as long as the variant classification that determines the strength level does not depend on PM5 application.

---

### PM6 - De Novo (Assumed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** ***Not Applicable*** - See PS2.

---

### PP1 - Co-segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease.

**Note:** May be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data.

**VCEP Specifications:**

Segregations should be counted across families, with the total number of segregations determining the strength level.

| Strength | Default Points | Criteria |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Strong** | 4 | 3 affected segregations (in addition to proband) across >=2 families. |
| **Moderate** | 2 | 2 affected segregations (in addition to proband; may be from a single family). |
| **Supporting** | 1 | 1 affected segregation (in addition to proband). |

> **Important:** When applied together, PP1 and PP4 cannot exceed 5 Bayesian pts (Supporting + Strong or Moderate + Moderate). If PP1_Moderate is applied and the criteria for PP4_Strong are also met, a downgraded PP4_Moderate can be applied.

---

### PP2 - Missense in Constrained Gene

**Original ACMG Summary:** Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.

**VCEP Specifications:** ***Not Applicable*** - SGCG is not constrained for missense variation (Z-score <3).

---

### PP3 - Computational Evidence

**Original ACMG Summary:** Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.).

**Caveat:** As many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion. PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Default Points | Criteria |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Supporting** | 1 | For missense variants: REVEL score >=0.7. For variants that may affect splicing: SpliceAI score >=0.5. |

- For any variant with RNA or other experimental data indicating an impact on splicing, follow the SVI Working Group's recommendations (Walker et al. 2023; PMID: 37352859). See Appendix B.

---

### PP4 - Phenotype Specificity

**Original ACMG Summary:** Patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

**VCEP Specifications:**

Use the PP4 table to determine the appropriate PP4 strength level. Apply PP4 only once, for a patient meeting the highest possible strength level.

| Strength | Default Points | Criteria |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Strong** | 4 | All of: clinical + genetic testing + protein expression criteria met (see table below). |
| **Moderate** | 2 | If PP1_Moderate is applied and criteria for PP4_Strong are also met, a downgraded PP4_Moderate can be applied. |
| **Supporting** | 1 | Clinical + genetic testing criteria met (see table below). |

#### PP4 Criteria Table

|  |  | PP4 Strength |  |
|--|--|:---:|:---:|
|  |  | **Supporting** | **Strong** |
| **Clinical** | Progressive limb-girdle pattern of muscle weakness observed over >=6 months OR clinical suspicion of LGMD | Y (required) | Y (required) |
| **Genetic testing** | 2 presumed diagnostic variants in SGCG, 1 of which is the variant under curation | Y (required) | Y (required) |
| **Protein expression in patient tissue** | Reduced expression or membrane localization of full-length protein in skeletal muscle (e.g., WB or IHC) | N (not required) | Y (required) |

**Notes:**
- Clinical features may be accompanied by supporting EMG, MRI, muscle histology, elevated CK but these are not required.
- **Genetic testing for Supporting:** Screening of all exons and exon/intron boundaries of SGCG required. **For Strong:** Screening of SGCA, SGCB, and SGCD also required. Do not apply if 2 presumed diagnostic variants also identified in SGCA, SGCB, or SGCD. Screening of additional neuromuscular disease genes (e.g., through a panel) is recommended but not required.
- **Presumed diagnostic variants:** If variants have not yet been curated by the LGMD VCEP, confirm they cannot be classified as LB or B (e.g., through application of BA1, BS1, and/or BP4/BP7). If phase is unknown, do not apply if the identified variants were ever confirmed in cis or if gnomAD co-occurrence data predict the variants may be part of the same haplotype in at least one genetic ancestry group.
- **Reduced protein expression:** <~30% normal; may be described as "severely" / "drastically" / "strongly" reduced or as "absent", "trace", or "barely detectable".
- When applied together, PP1 and PP4 cannot exceed 5 Bayesian pts (Supporting + Strong or Moderate + Moderate). If PP1_Moderate is applied and the criteria for PP4_Strong are also met, a downgraded PP4_Moderate can be applied.

---

### PP5 - Reputable Source

**Original ACMG Summary:** Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation.

**VCEP Specifications:** ***Not Applicable*** - This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee (PMID: 29543229).

---

## Benign Criteria

### BA1 - Allele Frequency >5%

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is above 5% in population databases.

**VCEP Specification (Stand Alone):**

Apply if the variant **Grpmax FAF** (the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the maximum credible genetic ancestry group allele frequency) is **>0.002**.

- This value can be taken directly from gnomAD, but do not use data for which the variant does not pass quality control filters.
- See the benign frequency exceptions list (Appendix D) for variants defined as exceptions to the benign frequency rules.
- Ongoing updates to the exceptions list will be available at the [LGMD VCEP webpage](https://clinicalgenome.org/affiliation/50061/).
- Variants whose frequency may not be reliable (e.g., variants that may reflect a sequencing artifact) should be critically evaluated and brought to the attention of the LGMD VCEP.

---

### BS1 - Frequency Greater Than Expected

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.

**VCEP Specification (Strong):**

Apply if the variant **Grpmax FAF** (the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the maximum credible genetic ancestry group allele frequency) is **>0.0009**.

- Default Point Value: -4
- This value can be taken directly from gnomAD, but do not use data for which the variant does not pass quality control filters.
- See the benign frequency exceptions list (Appendix D) for variants defined as exceptions to the benign frequency rules.
- Ongoing updates to the exceptions list will be available at the [LGMD VCEP webpage](https://clinicalgenome.org/affiliation/50061/).
- Variants whose frequency may not be reliable (e.g., variants that may reflect a sequencing artifact) should be critically evaluated and brought to the attention of the LGMD VCEP.

---

### BS2 - Observed in Healthy Adult

**Original ACMG Summary:** Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.

**VCEP Specifications:** ***Not Applicable*** - Not applicable as LGMD is characterized by variable expressivity and late-onset LGMD is not uncommon.

---

### BS3 - Functional Studies (No Effect)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.

**VCEP Specifications:** ***Not Applicable*** - Since muscle disease mechanisms are complex, it is not feasible at this time to exclude all pathogenic functional abnormalities through available assays.

### BS4 - Lack of Segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.

**Caveat:** The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e. cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Default Points | Criteria |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Strong** | -4 | Use as is. One affected individual (genotype-, phenotype+) is sufficient for BS4. Do not apply for genotype+, phenotype- individuals, as LGMD is characterized by variable expressivity and late onset is not uncommon. |

### BP1-BP7 - Benign Supporting

| Criterion | Status | Default Points | Specification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **BP1** | Not Applicable | — | Not applicable as missense variants are also known to cause disease. |
| **BP2** | Applicable (Supporting) | -1 | Use when variant is found *in cis* with a variant classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic using the LGMD VCEP specifications. |
| **BP3** | Not Applicable | — | Not applicable. Repetitive regions without a known function are not well described in SGCG. |
| **BP4** | Applicable (Supporting) | -1 | For missense variants: REVEL score <=0.1 **AND** SpliceAI score <=0.05. For variants that may affect splicing: SpliceAI score <=0.05. For any variant with RNA or other experimental data indicating no impact on splicing, follow Walker et al. 2023 (PMID: 37352859). |
| **BP5** | Not Applicable | — | Not applicable. |
| **BP6** | Not Applicable | — | Not for use per ClinGen SVI recommendation (PMID: 29543229). |
| **BP7** | Applicable (Supporting & Strong) | -1 / -4 | **Supporting:** SpliceAI score <=0.05. BP7 may be co-applied with BP4 for synonymous, UTR, and intronic variants located outside splice donor/acceptor regions (+6/-3 for donor; +1/-20 for acceptor). **Strong (-4 pts):** Apply BP7_Strong if a splicing assay shows no effect on splicing and a protein impact can be ruled out. Follow Walker et al. 2023 (PMID: 37352859). |

## Rules for Combining Criteria

This VCEP uses the **Bayesian point-based classification framework** (Tavtigian et al., 2020).

### Point-Based Variant Classification

| Category | Point Range |
|----------|-------------|
| **Pathogenic** | 10 (operator not stated) |
| **Likely Pathogenic** | 6 to 9 |
| **Uncertain Significance** | 0 to 5 |
| **Likely Benign** | -6 to -1 |
| **Benign** | -7 (operator not stated) |

**Additional Note:** A Benign classification can also be assigned when BA1 applies.

> The distributed criteria PDF prints the bare values `10` and `-7`; it does not state `>=` or `<=` for totals beyond them.

### Default Point Values for Each Criterion

| Strength Level | Points |
|----------------|--------|
| Very Strong (Pathogenic) | 8 |
| Strong (Pathogenic) | 4 |
| Moderate (Pathogenic) | 2 |
| Supporting (Pathogenic) | 1 |
| Supporting (Benign) | -1 |
| Strong (Benign) | -4 |
| Stand Alone (BA1) | Benign classification |

### PP1 + PP4 Interaction Rule

When applied together, PP1 and PP4 cannot exceed 5 Bayesian points:
- Supporting (1) + Strong (4) = 5 pts (allowed)
- Moderate (2) + Moderate (2) = 4 pts (allowed)
- If PP1_Moderate is applied and criteria for PP4_Strong are also met, PP4 should be downgraded to PP4_Moderate

## Appendices

### Appendix A: PVS1 Decision Tree for SGCG

The PVS1 decision tree for SGCG covers the following variant types with gene-specific modifications:

1. **Nonsense or Frameshift** - Premature truncation in codons 35-216 predicted to undergo NMD = PVS1. Truncation in codons 1-34 = PVS1_Moderate.
2. **Canonical splice sites (GT-AG +/-1,2)** - Use SpliceAI to predict most likely splice effect. In-frame exons where exon skipping is not expected to result in NMD: exons 2, 3, 5, 8.
3. **Deletions** - Single/multi-exon and full gene deletions assessed per standard PVS1 framework.
4. **Duplications** - Must be completely contained within the gene. Proven in tandem with frameshift + NMD = PVS1.
5. **Initiation codon** - The only operative branch is no known alternative start codon plus no upstream pathogenic variant -> PVS1_Supporting. The alternative-transcript/N/A and >=1-upstream-pathogenic/PVS1_Moderate paths are visibly struck through.

**Biologically relevant transcript:** NM_000231.3

**Critical functional regions:** None specified by VCEP.

The slide's critical-region/PVS1_Strong paths are visibly struck through and are not operative. Its strict `>10%` and `<10%` paths leave exactly 10% unassigned. Footnotes `a`–`d` are undefined in the slide and speaker notes.

### Appendix B: Experimental Splice Data Flowchart

For variants with RNA/splicing data, follow the distributed `experimental splice data.png`:

- Categorization must consider assay/technique, RNA source, and gene-specific knowledge.
- **No variant-specific observed impact:**
  - Silent/intronic variant -> apply BP7_S (RNA), then consider splicing-prediction data; the image shows `BP7_S (RNA) + prediction (PP3/BP4)`.
  - Other variant -> assess pathogenicity through the protein pathway. If the protein impact can be ruled out from functional and/or clinical data, apply BP7_S (RNA) plus prediction (PP3/BP4); otherwise document `BP7_S (RNA) Not Met` to record that the data were reviewed.
- **Variant-specific impact compared with controls:** Follow the gene PVS1 flowchart for observed RNA impact. Once a PVS1 strength is assigned for at least one transcript, evaluate the proportion of alternative transcript(s) inferred to be produced by the variant allele: complete -> keep strength; near complete -> reduce by one level; incomplete -> do not apply codes. If the background rate is at low-moderate levels suggestive of being tolerated, consider a further one-level reduction. Determine the PVS1 (RNA) weight from the combined analysis; PP3/BP4 are not applicable. If PVS1 (RNA) or BP7_S (RNA) is not applicable, reconsider the PVS1 decision tree as appropriate.

> **Distributed-image limitations:** Footnote markers `(d)` and `(e)` are not defined. The image is clipped at its left boundary and begins with a partial incoming arrow, but no visible criterion text is missing.

### Appendix C: PS1 Splicing Table

**PS1 code weights for variants with same predicted splicing event as a known (likely) pathogenic variant:**

| Variant Under Assessment (VUA) | Baseline Computational/Predictive Code Applicable to VUA | Position of Comparison Variant Relative to VUA | PS1 Code (with P comparison variant) | PS1 Code (with LP comparison variant) |
|------|------|------|------|------|
| Located outside splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 dinucleotide positions | PP3 | Same nucleotide | PS1 | PS1_Moderate |
| Located outside splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 dinucleotide positions | PP3 | Within same splice donor/acceptor motif (including at +/-1,2 positions) | PS1_Moderate | PS1_Supporting |
| Located at splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 dinucleotide positions | PVS1 | Within same splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 dinucleotide | PS1_Supporting | N/A |
| Located at splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 dinucleotide positions | PVS1 | Within same splice donor/acceptor region, but outside +/-1,2 dinucleotide | PS1_Supporting | PS1_Supporting |
| Located at splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 dinucleotide positions | PVS1_Strong, PVS1_Moderate, or PVS1_Supporting | Within same splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 dinucleotide | PS1 | N/A |
| Located at splice donor/acceptor +/-1,2 dinucleotide positions | PVS1_Strong, PVS1_Moderate, or PVS1_Supporting | Within same splice donor/acceptor motif, but outside +/-1,2 dinucleotide | PS1_Moderate | PS1_Supporting |

**Prerequisites for all:** The predicted event of the VUA must precisely match the predicted event of the comparison (likely) pathogenic variant (e.g., both predicted to lead to exon skipping, or both to lead to enhanced use of a cryptic splice motif, AND the strength of the prediction for the VUA must be of similar or higher strength than the strength of the prediction for the comparison [likely] pathogenic variant). For an exonic variant, predicted or proven functional effect of missense substitution(s) encoded by the VUA and (likely) pathogenic variant should also be considered before application of this code. Dinucleotide positions refer to donor and acceptor dinucleotides in reference transcript(s) used for curation.

**Designated donor and acceptor motif ranges** should be based on position weight matrices for intron category (see methods). For GT-AG introns these are defined as follows: the donor motif, last 3 bases of the exon and 6 nucleotides of intronic sequence adjacent to the exon; acceptor motif, first base of the exon and 20 nucleotides upstream from the exon boundary. Consider other motif ranges for non-GT-AG introns.

*If relevant, splicing assay data for a pathogenic variant outside a +/-1,2 dinucleotide position may be used to update a PVS1 decision tree and hence the applicable PVS1 code for a +/-1,2 dinucleotide variant.*

### Appendix D: Benign Frequency Exceptions

The following variants are defined as exceptions to the benign frequency rules (BA1/BS1):

| Variant | Status | Comment |
|---------|--------|---------|
| NM_003494.3(DYSF):c.2643+1G>A | BS1 exception | Common pathogenic variant |
| NM_213599.3(ANO5):c.191dup (p.Asn64LysfsTer15) | BS1 exception | Common pathogenic variant |
| NM_000070.3(CAPN3):c.1746-20C>G | BS1 exception | Proposed hypomorph |
| NM_000070.3(CAPN3):c.2120A>G (p.Asp707Gly) | BS1 exception | Likely founder in East Asian population |

> **Note:** These exceptions are from the broader LGMD VCEP and may include variants in other LGMD genes. None of the current exceptions are in SGCG. Ongoing updates to this list will be available at the [LGMD VCEP webpage](https://clinicalgenome.org/affiliation/50061/).
