## Pathogenic Criteria

### PVS1 - Null Variant

**Original ACMG Summary:** Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical +/-1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease.

**VCEP Specifications:**

*Not Applicable*

**Comments:** Not applicable. The disease mechanism for SOS1-related RASopathy is gain-of-function, not loss-of-function. PVS1 cannot be applied to SOS1 variants.

---

### PS1 - Same Amino Acid Change

**Original ACMG Summary:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.

**VCEP Specifications:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change. Applicable for observed analogous residue positions in *SOS1* and *SOS2*. | Analogous Gene |

> **Note:** Analogous residue positions between SOS1 (NP_005624.2) and SOS2 (NP_008870.2) are documented in the supplemental analogous residues file. PS1 can be applied when a pathogenic variant at an analogous position in SOS2 has been established.

---

### PS2 - De Novo (Confirmed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history.

**VCEP Specifications:** Follow SVI recommendations for point-based scoring in conjunction with PM6 (see Reference 1) and phenotypic specifications: full points awarded with RASopathy phenotypes, reduced points applicable to cases with minimal phenotypic information (i.e. prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES)).

#### PS2/PM6 Points per Proband

| Phenotypic Consistency | Confirmed *de novo* (PS2) | Assumed *de novo* (PM6) |
|------------------------|:-------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| Phenotype is consistent with a RASopathy\* | 2 | 1 |
| Limited phenotypic information\*\* | 1 | 0.5 |
| Phenotype not consistent with RASopathy | 0 | 0 |

\*Exclusive of prenatal cases

\*\*Applicable to prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES). Phenotypes for prenatal cases include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, increased nuchal translucency, cystic hygroma, or hydrops.

#### PS2/PM6 Evidence Strength Thresholds

The SOS1 PDF body explicitly lists PS2 at Very Strong (4), Strong (2), and Moderate (1), and PM6 at Strong (2), Moderate (1), and Supporting (0.5). The supplied `PS2_PM6 Scoring.jpg` extends the shared scale to all four strengths for either criterion, including PS2_Supporting and PM6_VeryStrong:

| Points | Strength Level |
|:------:|----------------|
| 0.5 | Supporting (PS2_Supporting or PM6_Supporting) |
| 1.0 | Moderate (PS2_Moderate or PM6) |
| 2.0 | Strong (PS2 or PM6_Strong) |
| 4.0 | Very Strong (PS2_VeryStrong or PM6_VeryStrong) |

---

### PS3 - Functional Studies

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product.

**VCEP Specifications:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product. Approved assays are available in the supplemental materials.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Moderate** | Two or more different approved assays showing damaging effect. | Disease-specific, Gene-specific, Strength |
| **Supporting** | One approved assay showing damaging effect. | Disease-specific, Gene-specific, Strength |

> **Note:** PS3 at Strong level is not available for SOS1. Maximum achievable strength is Moderate (with two or more different approved assays).

#### Approved Assay Instances for SOS1

| Assay | Description | Specificity | Approved Strength | PMIDs |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **RAS Activation Assay** | Measures the bound RAS protein that immunoprecipitated with RAF1 or RBD (synthetic). Increased RAS/RBD complexes compared with positive control range indicates abnormal. | Pathway Specific | PS3_Supporting; BS3_NA | 17143282, 17143285 |
| **MEK Activation Assay** | Measures the ratio of phosphorylated MEK to unphosphorylated MEK, basally and following RTK stimulation. Increased pMEK/MEK ratio compared with positive control range indicates abnormal. | Pathway Specific | PS3_Supporting; BS3_NA | 17143282, 17143285 |
| **ERK Activation Assay** | Measures the ratio of phosphorylated ERK to unphosphorylated ERK, basally and following stimulation. Increased pERK/ERK ratio compared with positive control range indicates abnormal. | Pathway Specific | PS3_Supporting; BS3_NA | 17143282, 17143285 |

> **General Guidance:** All assays are expected to be validated by the performing laboratory in accordance with standard procedures with all appropriate control inclusions (PMID: 31892348). As most of these assays are semi-quantitative, abnormal results should be compared relative to the known status of the controls included in the assay. Multiple assays are pathway-specific, meaning controls from any RASopathy gene may be used to support abnormal pathway function. Assays not listed are presumed to lack sufficient historical evidence and may only be sufficient for PS3_Supporting or BS3_Supporting. Animal models and variant-specific assays (e.g., myristoylation) have been excluded.

---

### PS4 - Prevalence in Affected

**Original ACMG Summary:** The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls.

**VCEP Specifications:** Strength adjustment using point-based scoring for autosomal dominant cases with phenotypic specifications: full points awarded with RASopathy phenotypes, reduced points applicable to cases with minimal phenotypic information (i.e. prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES)).

#### PS4 Points per Proband

| Phenotypic Consistency | Points per Proband |
|------------------------|:------------------:|
| Individual well-phenotyped with features of a RASopathy | 1 |
| Limited phenotypic information compatible with RASopathy\* | 0.5 |
| No clinical information or isolated clinical features | 0 |
| Well-phenotyped but consistent with non-RASopathy disorder\*\* | -1 |

\*Applicable to prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES). Phenotypes for prenatal cases include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, increased nuchal translucency, cystic hygroma, or hydrops.

\*\*Negative points for PS4 represent proband affected with a non-RASopathy congenital disorder rather than a healthy individual (BS2). This typically applies to probands tested by exome analysis with multiple other clinical features supporting a distinct syndromic disorder (e.g. CHARGE, CdLS).

#### PS4 Evidence Strength Thresholds

| Points | Strength Level |
|:------:|----------------|
| ≥1.0 | Supporting (PS4_Supporting) |
| ≥3.0 | Moderate (PS4_Moderate) |
| ≥5.0 | Strong (PS4) |

---

### PM1 - Mutational Hot Spot

**Original ACMG Summary:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation.

**VCEP Specifications:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation. PM1 and PM5 may be used in conjunction at moderate levels, however, PM1 may not be applied if PM5_Strong is applied to avoid overweighting.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Moderate** | Applicable only to critical and well-established functional domains available in the supplementary table: **PH domain [AA 420-500]**. Not applicable to specific amino acid residues (see PM5). | Gene-specific |

> **Important:** PM1 and PM5 may be used together at moderate levels, but PM1 may **not** be applied if PM5_Strong is applied, to avoid overweighting.

#### SOS1 Functional Domains

| Domain | Amino Acid Range |
|--------|:----------------:|
| Histone folds | AA 1-198 |
| Dbl homology | AA 198-418 |
| **Pleckstrin homology (PH)** | **AA 418-546** (PM1 applicable: AA 420-500) |
| Helical linker | AA 546-567 |
| RAS exchanger motif | AA 567-750 |
| Cdc25 | AA 750-1050 |
| SH3-binding motifs | AA 1050-1333 |

---

### PM2 - Absent from Controls

**Original ACMG Summary:** Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

**VCEP Specification (Supporting only):**

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Supporting** | The variant must be absent from controls (gnomAD). | Strength |

> **Note:** PM2 can only be applied at **Supporting** level for SOS1.

---

### PM3 - In Trans with Pathogenic

**Original ACMG Summary:** For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant.

**VCEP Specifications:**

*Not Applicable*

**Comments:** Not applicable. SOS1-related RASopathy follows autosomal dominant inheritance.

---

### PM4 - Protein Length Changes

**Original ACMG Summary:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

**VCEP Specifications:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Moderate** | No known repetitive areas in gene. Use as described. | General recommendation |

---

### PM5 - Novel Missense at Same Residue

**Original ACMG Summary:** Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before.

**VCEP Specifications:** Applicable for observed analogous residue positions in *SOS1* and *SOS2*. PM1 and PM5 may be used in conjunction at moderate levels, however, PM1 may not be applied if PM5_Strong is applied to avoid overweighting.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | ≥2 different [likely] pathogenic “residues changes” at the same codon observed in ≥5 probands. | Analogous Gene, Strength |
| **Moderate** | 1 [likely] pathogenic residue change at the same codon. | Analogous Gene, Disease-specific |

> **Note:** Analogous residue positions between SOS1 and SOS2 can be used for PM5 application.

> **Source wording:** “residues changes” is preserved from the PDF and appears to be a grammatical typo.

> **Supplement status:** `Analogous Residues.xlsx` contains the full SOS1 (NP_005624.2) / SOS2 (NP_008870.2) protein alignment rather than an exhaustive discrete residue-lookup table. Its working case-count sheet labels aligned positions 264 and 267 `PM5_Strong`, but also contains the unfinished instruction “Need to add SOS2 from literature, and cases from NSEuro net.” Treat those two labels as provisional workbook content and apply the published PM5 rule above rather than treating them as independently validated classifications.

---

### PM6 - De Novo (Assumed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** Follow SVI recommendations for point-based scoring in conjunction with PS2 (see Reference 1) and phenotypic specifications: full points awarded with RASopathy phenotypes, reduced points applicable to cases with minimal phenotypic information (i.e. prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES)).

Uses the same point-based system as PS2 — see [PS2/PM6 Point System](#ps2---de-novo-confirmed) above.

| Strength | Points | Modification Type |
|----------|:------:|-------------------|
| **Strong** | 2 Points | Strength |
| **Moderate** | 1 Point | None |
| **Supporting** | 0.5 Points | Strength |

The supplied scoring image additionally shows **PM6_VeryStrong at 4 points**. This strength is absent from the PM6 rows in the PDF body but present in the VCEP-distributed supplement; see the shared PS2/PM6 table above.

---

### PP1 - Co-segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease.

**VCEP Specifications:** Segregation in more than one family is recommended.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | ≥7 informative meioses | Strength |
| **Moderate** | ≥5 informative meioses | Strength |
| **Supporting** | ≥3 informative meioses | Disease-specific |

---

### PP2 - Missense in Constrained Gene

**Original ACMG Summary:** Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.

**VCEP Specifications:**

*Not Applicable*

**Comments:** Not applicable because missense z score is <3.09 in gnomAD.

---

### PP3 - Computational Evidence

**Original ACMG Summary:** Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.).

**VCEP Specifications:** For missense variants: REVEL ≥ 0.7. For splicing impact, predicted outcome must match disease mechanism.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |

| **Supporting** | For missense variants: REVEL ≥ 0.7. For splicing impact, predicted outcome must match disease mechanism. | Disease-specific |

---

### PP4 - Phenotype Specificity

**Original ACMG Summary:** Patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

**VCEP Specifications:**

*Not Applicable*

**Comments:** Not applicable, see PS4. Phenotypic specificity is incorporated into the PS4 point-based scoring system.

---

### PP5 - Reputable Source

**Original ACMG Summary:** Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation.

**VCEP Specifications:**

*Not Applicable*

This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee. (PubMed: 29543229)

---

## Benign Criteria

### BA1 - Allele Frequency >5%

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is above 5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

**VCEP Specification (Stand Alone):**
- gnomAD filtering allele frequency **≥0.05%**

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Stand Alone** | gnomAD filtering allele frequency ≥0.05% | Disease-specific |

---

### BS1 - Frequency Greater Than Expected

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.

**VCEP Specification (Strong):**
- gnomAD filtering allele frequency **≥0.025%**

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | gnomAD filtering allele frequency ≥0.025% | Disease-specific |

---

### BS2 - Observed in Healthy Adult

**Original ACMG Summary:** Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.

**VCEP Specifications:** Strength adjustment using point-based scoring based on phenotypic specifications. Phenotypic specifications: based on healthy homozygote or heterozygote individuals, reduced points for apparently unaffected heterozygous individuals, applicable to parent or sibling samples during clinical family evaluations.

#### BS2 Points per Individual

| Phenotypic Consistency | Points per Individual |
|------------------------|:---------------------:|
| Healthy homozygous individual assessed for a RASopathy | -3 |
| Healthy heterozygous individual assessed for a RASopathy | -1 |
| No phenotypic information other than "unaffected" heterozygote\* | -0.25 |
| No clinical information or nonspecific clinical features | 0 |

\*Typically applicable to parental or sibling samples during clinical family evaluations.

#### BS2 Evidence Strength Thresholds

> **Source contradiction — do not resolve silently:** The PDF body assigns **BS2 Strong at -4 points** and **BS2 Supporting at -1 point**. The VCEP-distributed `BS2 Scoring.jpg` instead assigns **BS2 Strong at -3 points**, Supporting at -1, and says Moderate is not available. The per-individual and threshold tables below reproduce the supplied image; the body wording remains authoritative-looking but conflicts with it.

| PDF body strength | Points |
|-------------------|:------:|
| Strong | -4 |
| Supporting | -1 |

| Points | Strength Level |
|:------:|----------------|
| -1 point | Supporting (BS2_Supporting) |
| N/A | Moderate (not available) |
| -3.0 points | Strong (BS2) |

---

### BS3 - Functional Studies (No Effect)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.

**VCEP Specifications:**

*Not Applicable*

**Comments:** Approved functional studies are available for each individual gene in the supplemental material. Additional functional studies can be submitted to the expert panel for approval. Currently, no approved assays support BS3 application for SOS1. The approved pathway-specific assays (RAS, MEK, ERK activation) are designated BS3_NA (not applicable for benign evidence).

---

### BS4 - Lack of Segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.

**VCEP Specifications:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | Requires only one informative meiosis. | General recommendation |

---

### BP1-BP7 - Benign Supporting

| Criterion | Status | Specification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **BP1** | Modified | Truncating, LOF variant in a gene for which primarily missense, GOF variants are known to cause disease. This rule has contraindications for use with RASopathies. Given the disease mechanism is gain-of-function for RASopathies, BP1 should be used for any truncating variant (nonsense, frameshift, affects canonical splice sites, initiation codon, entire gene or multi exon deletion) in genes without established LOF correlation to disease. See supplemental material regarding dosage sensitivity. **Supporting.** |
| **BP2** | Modified — Point-based | Points are awarded for an alternative molecular cause of a RASopathy in the same gene (and/or in conjunction with BP5) and the phenotype is consistent with expected severity of the RASopathy. **Supporting** ≥(-1) point; **Moderate** ≥(-2) points; **Strong** ≥(-4) points. |
| **BP3** | Not Applicable | No known benign repetitive areas in RASopathy genes. |
| **BP4** | Modified | For missense variants: REVEL ≤0.3. For splicing variants: predicted outcome is negligible or does not match disease mechanism. **Supporting.** |
| **BP5** | Modified — Point-based | Points are awarded for an alternative molecular cause of a RASopathy in a different gene (and/or in conjunction with BP2) and the phenotype is consistent with expected severity of the RASopathy. Points also awarded for phenotypes inconsistent with a RASopathy and fully explained by a different causative variant (e.g. WES testing). **Supporting** ≥(-1) point; **Moderate** ≥(-2) points; **Strong** ≥(-4) points. |
| **BP6** | Not Applicable | This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen SVI VCEP Review Committee. (PubMed: 29543229) |
| **BP7** | Modified | A synonymous (silent) variant for which splicing prediction algorithms predict no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved. Also applicable for intronic positions (except canonical splice sites) or non-coding variants and should be used in conjunction with BP4. **Supporting.** |

#### BP5/BP2 Points per Individual

| Phenotypic Consistency | Points per Individual |
|------------------------|:---------------------:|
| Phenotype inconsistent with a RASopathy and causative variant has been identified, **-or-** Molecular cause of a RASopathy is identified in a different RASopathy gene, **-or-** Molecular cause of a RASopathy is identified in *trans* or *cis* with the variant being classified | -1 |
| Phenotype inconsistent with a RASopathy and no causative variant identified/reported | 0 |

#### BP5/BP2 Evidence Strength Thresholds

> **Source contradiction — do not resolve silently:** The PDF body assigns Strong at **≥(-4)**, Moderate at **≥(-2)**, and Supporting at **≥(-1)** for both BP2 and BP5. The VCEP-distributed `BP5_BP2 Scoring.jpg` instead assigns Strong at **-3**, says Moderate is **N/A**, and assigns Supporting at **-1**. The criterion summary above preserves the PDF-body values, while the table below reproduces the supplied image. The image states exact values without comparator symbols.

| Points | Strength Level |
|:------:|----------------|
| -1 point | Supporting (BP5/BP2) |
| N/A | Moderate (not available) |
| -3.0 points | Strong (BP5_Strong/BP2_Strong) |

SOS1 variants may use analogous residue positions from **SOS2** for the application of PS1 and PM5 criteria. The alignment between SOS1 (NP_005624.2) and SOS2 (NP_008870.2) is documented in the supplemental analogous residues file.

## Version History

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| 2.3.0 | 12/3/2024 | Submitting Pilot Rules. All pilot variants are attached in the LZTR1 submission. "Observed in ≥5 probands" removed from PM5 at Moderate strength. |

**Document corrections (2026-08-07), source-verified against `ClinGen_ACMG_Specifications_SOS1_v2.3.pdf`, `PS2_PM6 Scoring.jpg`, `PS4 Scoring.jpg`, `BP5_BP2 Scoring.jpg`, `BS2 Scoring.jpg`, `Approved Functional Studies.xlsx`, and `Analogous Residues.xlsx`. No change to the underlying ClinGen specification version.**

- **Source contradictions restored instead of silently reconciled:** the PDF body sets BS2 Strong at -4 while the supplied image sets it at -3; the PDF body gives BP2/BP5 Strong ≥(-4), Moderate ≥(-2), and Supporting ≥(-1), while the image gives -3, N/A, and -1. Both source readings are now shown with their provenance and comparator status.
- **PS2/PM6 supplement-only strengths identified:** the scoring image adds PS2_Supporting and PM6_VeryStrong to body sections that do not list those strengths. PM6's maximum strength in Appendix A was corrected from Strong to the supplement-defined Very Strong, without implying that it appears in the PDF-body PM6 rows.
- **Functional evidence corrected:** PMID 17143285 was restored to the MEK activation assay; source-backed DOI/provenance wording replaced paper-title-style descriptions not supplied by the package.
- **Analogous-residue limitations recorded:** the workbook supplies a full alignment and an unfinished case-count worksheet, not a clean exhaustive lookup table. Its provisional PM5_Strong labels at aligned positions 264 and 267 are now explicitly identified as such; the PDF's “residues changes” typo is preserved and flagged.
