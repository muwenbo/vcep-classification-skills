## Pathogenic Criteria

### PVS1 - Null Variant

**Original ACMG Summary:** Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical +/-1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease.

**Caveats:**
- Beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g. GFAP, MYH7)
- Use caution interpreting LOF variants at the extreme 3' end of a gene
- Use caution with splice variants that are predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the protein intact
- Use caution in the presence of multiple transcripts

**VCEP Specifications:** Use GCK PVS1 decision tree (see [Appendix A](#appendix-a-pvs1-decision-tree)).

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Very Strong** | Use GCK PVS1 decision tree created based on PVS1 decision tree from ClinGen SVI group. See detailed specifications below. |
| **Strong** | Apply PVS1_Strong to duplications ≥1 exon in size, contained completely within gene, presumed in tandem, reading frame presumed disrupted, and NMD predicted to occur. |
| **Supporting** | Apply PVS1_Supporting to initiation codon variants. The next methionine is at codon 8 and there are no variants classified as pathogenic 5' of p.Met8. |

#### Gene-Specific PVS1 Notes

**NMD Escape Region:**
- Variants generating PTCs 3' of c.1198 (p.Asp400) of NM_000162.3, which includes the last 55 nucleotides of exon 9 and exon 10, are not expected to cause NMD
- The α13 helix (p.444-456), located at the C-end of the protein, has a critical role in GCK conformational change upon glucose binding
- Individuals with PTCs in exon 10 have a MODY phenotype; therefore, **PVS1 (Very Strong)** level of evidence will be applied for PTCs in exon 10

**Exon Skipping/Deletions:**
| Exon(s) | Effect | Strength |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Exon 1 | In-frame but >20 families with GCK-MODY phenotype and exon 1 deletion (some also have promoter deletions) | PVS1 |
| Exons 2, 3, 6, 7 | Cause frameshift | PVS1 |
| Exons 8, 9 | In-frame, proportion >10% (52 AA and 78 AA, respectively) | PVS1 |
| Exons 4, 5 | In-frame, proportion <10% (40 AA and 32 AA). Exon 4 (p.122-161) and exon 5 (p.162-193) contain each a part of the active site that binds glucose (p.151-180) | PVS1 |
| Exon 10 | 47 AA - Multiple patients with GCK-MODY phenotype reported with missense, frameshift, PTC, splice acceptor, and stop loss variants | PVS1 |

**Important Notes:**
- Per recommendations from the SVI, when RNA analysis demonstrates abnormal splicing from non-canonical splice site variants, apply **PS3** instead of PVS1
- Full gene deletion warrants pathogenic classification given GCK is a known haploinsufficient gene (in the absence of conflicting data)
- The panel had reviewed only one initiation-codon variant, c.3G>A, classified as VUS with PVS1_Supporting + PM2_Supporting (one submitted case, `dx.53`, with no other information provided to the laboratory)

---

### PS1 - Same Amino Acid Change

**Original ACMG Summary:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.

**Example:** Val->Leu caused by either G>C or G>T in the same codon.

**Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Applicable for a same amino acid change if the previously established variant is classified as **pathogenic** by ClinGen MDEP specifications. |
| **Moderate** | Applicable for a same amino acid change if the previously established variant is classified as **likely pathogenic** by ClinGen MDEP specifications. |
| **Supporting** | See splicing guidance below. |

**Splicing Variants:** PS1 can also be applied for canonical and non-canonical splicing variants that have a SpliceAI score within 10% of the original variant, or a greater predicted deleterious impact than the comparison (likely) pathogenic variant. See Table 2 from PMID: 37352859 for determining when PS1 should be applied at the Strong, Moderate, or Supporting level in these instances.

---

### PS2 - De Novo (Confirmed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history.

**Note:** Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, etc. can contribute to non-maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:**

**Phenotype Requirements:**
- To obtain **maximum points** ("phenotype highly specific for gene"), patient must meet criteria for PP4
- To obtain **standard points** ("phenotype consistent with gene but not highly specific"), the phenotype of the patient must include hyperglycemia or impaired fasting glucose, with no evidence of an autoimmune etiology of diabetes and/or absolute or near-absolute insulin deficiency

**Exclusionary Evidence (autoimmune etiology or absolute/near-absolute insulin deficiency):**
- One or more positive diabetes autoantibodies (IA-2A, ZnT8A+, GAD)
- Very low or negative C-peptide, defined as either fasting or non-fasting random C-peptide (<200pmol/L or 0.6ng/mL) or urinary C-peptide/creatinine ratio <0.2 nmol/mmol
- Presence of clinically significant diabetes complications in anyone with the variant is an exclusion

**Determining Unaffected Status:**
- We expect to see hyperglycemia at birth in an individual with GCK-MODY and therefore consider an individual unaffected if euglycemic in childhood or adulthood
- Since individuals typically do not present with symptoms of diabetes, a statement that someone is "nondiabetic" is insufficient to consider a parent unaffected
- Fasting glucose must be tested and found to be within normal limits (<100 mg/dl = 5.5 mmol/L) or HbA1c <=5.5% (37 mmol/mol) since the GCK range was 5.6 - 7.6% (38-60 mmol/mol)

**Do NOT apply PS2 if the proband has an affected parent with any of the following:**
- Affected parent meets PP4 specifications
- Parent is described as having similarly atypical diabetes to the proband
- Parent was diagnosed with non-autoimmune diabetes before age 30

#### PS2/PM6 Point System

See [Appendix B](#appendix-b-ps2pm6-de-novo-points-table) for the complete points table.

**Table 1. Points\* awarded per *de novo* occurrence**

| Phenotypic consistency | *de novo* with confirmed parental relationships | *de novo* with unconfirmed parental relationships |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Phenotype highly specific for gene | 2 | 1 |
| Phenotype consistent with gene but not highly specific | 1 | 0.5 |

\*Note that these points are not equivalent to the points used to classify a variant per the Tavtigian et al 2020 “Fitting a naturally scaled point system to the ACMG/AMP variant classification guidelines”

**Table 2. Recommendation for determining the appropriate ACMG/AMP evidence strength level for *de novo* occurrence(s)**

| Supporting (PS2_Supporting or PM6_Supporting) | Moderate (PS2_Moderate or PM6) | Strong (PS2 or PM6_Strong) | Very Strong (PS2_VeryStrong or PM6_VeryStrong) |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 0.5 | 1 | 2 | 4 |

*Table 2 prints exact bare values, not thresholds or ranges. PM6 remains Not Applicable for GCK as specified below.*

---

### PS3 - Functional Studies

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product.

**Note:** Functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well-established.

**VCEP Specifications:**

Use GCK PS3/BS3 decision tree (see [Appendix E](#appendix-e-ps3bs3-decision-tree)), which incorporates:
- **Relative Activity Index (RAI)**
- **Relative Stability Index (RSI)**
- Assays that measure the impact of variants on binding with **GKRP** and **GKA**

**Important Requirements:**
- For canonical splice site variants, do not use PS3 for RNA studies demonstrating abnormal splicing, since PVS1 will already be used at some level
- To use PS3, functional study must have been performed on a **transfected variant**
- If a study was performed on a cell line generated from a patient sample (and therefore contains the variant plus any other genomic variation the patient has), it does not count as PS3

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Applicable to non-canonical splice site variants that have RNA and in silico evidence of aberrant splicing. |
| **Moderate** | RAI ≤0.5 (see decision tree for details). |
| **Supporting** | MT: Kcat/S0.5 / WT: Kcat/S0.5 < 0.5; OR RSI ≤0.5; OR RSI >0.5 with impact on GKRP and/or GKA interaction (see decision tree for exact topology). |

#### Functional Study Parameters

**WT GCK kinetic parameters that must be met (including SEM):**
1. Kcat: 40-80
2. S0.5: 6.0-9.0
3. h: 1.4-1.8

**Activity Index Calculation:**
```
Ia = [ATP]/([ATP] + Km) × Kcat/S0.5^h
RAI = Ia-MT / Ia-WT
```

**Decision Points:**
- Is the WT Km available and between 0.2-0.5? → If YES, ask whether the activity index (Ia) was calculated with the printed equation; if not, recalculate, then calculate RAI
- RAI ≤0.5 → **PS3_Moderate**
- If RAI is not ≤0.5, or if the MT:WT Kcat/S0.5 ratio is not <0.5, continue to RSI
- RSI unavailable → **Cannot Use PS3 or BS3**
- RSI ≤0.5 → **PS3_Supporting**
- RSI >0.5 and impact on GKRP and/or GKA interaction → **PS3_Supporting**
- RSI >0.5 and no impact on GKRP and/or GKA interaction → **BS3_Supporting**
- RSI >0.5 and GKRP/GKA interaction not assessed or determined → **Cannot Use PS3 or BS3**

---

### PS4 - Prevalence in Affected

**Original ACMG Summary:** The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls.

**Note 1:** Relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR), as obtained from case-control studies, is >5.0 and the confidence interval around the estimate of RR or OR does not include 1.0.

**Note 2:** In instances of very rare variants where case-control studies may not reach statistical significance, the prior observation of the variant in multiple unrelated patients with the same phenotype, and its absence in controls, may be used as moderate level of evidence.

**VCEP Specifications:**
- Variant should meet **PM2_Supporting** in order to use PS4 at any level
- Careful review of gnomAD QC data may be necessary to assess whether variant is real or an artifact, especially if variant is in a polyC region
- Phenotype of the patient must include diabetes, with evidence of an autoimmune etiology and/or absolute or near-absolute insulin deficiency considered as **exclusionary**

**Exclusionary Evidence:**
- One or more positive diabetes autoantibodies (IA-2A, ZnT8A+, GAD)
- Very low or negative C-peptide (<200pmol/L or 0.6ng/mL) or urinary C-peptide/creatinine ratio <0.2 nmol/mmol

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | 7 or more occurrences in unrelated individuals = Strong. |
| **Moderate** | 4-6 occurrences in unrelated individuals |

---

### PM1 - Mutational Hot Spot

**Original ACMG Summary:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation.

**VCEP Specifications:** The core says `See attached chart.` The physically supplied `GCK PM1 Residues.pdf` is summarized in [Appendix D](#appendix-d-pm1-residues); PM1 applies to its glucose- and ATP-binding sites.

#### PM1 (Moderate) - Applicable Residues

**Glucose-binding sites (22 residues):**
- Ser151 - Pro153
- Thr168 - Lys169
- Asn204 - Thr206
- Ile225 - Asn231
- Asn254 - Gly258
- Gln287
- Glu290

**ATP-binding sites (29 residues):**
- Asp78 - Arg85
- Ser151
- Lys169
- Asp205
- Ile225 - Gly229
- Gly295 - Lys296
- Glu331 - Arg333
- Ser336
- Gly410 - His416

---

### PM2 - Absent from Controls

**Original ACMG Summary:** Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

**Caveat:** Population data for indels may be poorly called by next generation sequencing.

**VCEP Specifications:**
- Recommend using as **supporting level** of evidence (PM2_Supporting) per ClinGen guidance
- Per guidance from ClinGen/SVI, PM2_Supporting + PVS1 is sufficient evidence of a variant being likely pathogenic
- We recommend investigating the genotype metrics in gnomAD for variants that have been flagged for having failed one or more quality parameters, as it is possible that some of these filtered variants are actually real
- The number of filtered alleles can be counted to determine whether PM2_Supporting would be met even if they were genuine calls
- If the filtered calls are sufficient in number to not meet PM2_Supporting, then we would not use it
- Because it is also possible that these calls are false positives, we would not use filtered variants to support BA1 or BS1
- Use Grpmax FAF cutoffs using combined frequencies or dataset (exomes or genomes) with highest denominator if combined not available in gnomAD v4.1

#### Strength Level

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Supporting** | gnomAD Grpmax FAF ≤ 1:333,000 (≤ 0.000003 or 0.0003%) |

---

### PM3 - In Trans with Pathogenic

**Original ACMG Summary:** For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant.

**Note:** This requires testing of parents (or offspring) to determine phase.

**VCEP Specifications:**
- Applicable for variants found in **neonatal diabetes**
- Criterion can also be used to interpret the pathogenicity of a heterozygous variant (i.e., GCK-MODY) if the variant under assessment has also been identified in a patient with neonatal diabetes in the homozygous state or in trans (or phase unknown per the point system) with a P/LP variant or VUS
- Use SVI-recommended point-based system (see [Appendix C](#appendix-c-pm3-points-table))

#### PM3 Point System

**Table 1: Points awarded per in trans proband**

| Classification/Zygosity of Other Variant | Confirmed in Trans | Phase Unknown |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Pathogenic or Likely pathogenic variant | 1.0 | 0.5 (P) / 0.25 (LP) |
| Homozygous occurrence (max point 1.0) | 0.5 | N/A |
| Uncertain significance variant (max point 0.5) | 0.25 | 0.0 |

*Note: All variants should be sufficiently rare (meet PM2 specification)*

**Table 2: Evidence Strength Thresholds**

| Total Points | Strength Level |
|--------------|----------------|
| 0.5 | PM3_Supporting |
| 1.0 | PM3 (Moderate) |
| 2.0 | PM3_Strong |
| 4.0 | PM3_VeryStrong |

---

### PM4 - Protein Length Changes

**Original ACMG Summary:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | For deletions/insertions of **more than one amino acid** in a non-repeat region |
| **Supporting** | Apply at the Supporting level when there is an insertion or deletion of a **single amino acid** in a non-repeat region |

---

### PM5 - Novel Missense at Same Residue

**Original ACMG Summary:** Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before.

**Example:** Arg156His is pathogenic; now you observe Arg156Cys.

**Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Applicable once **two amino acid changes** have been classified as pathogenic at the same amino acid residue |
| **Moderate** | The novel amino acid change must have a Grantham distance **greater than or equal to** the previously classified pathogenic variant |
| **Supporting** | Apply if the previously classified amino acid change is **likely pathogenic** (rather than pathogenic) OR if the previously classified variant is pathogenic but has a **greater Grantham distance** |

---

### PM6 - De Novo (Assumed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** *Not Applicable* - Subsumed in PS2.

---

### PP1 - Co-segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease.

**Note:** May be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data.

**VCEP Specifications:**
- Variable penetrance and phenocopies complicate co-segregation studies
- The presence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes phenocopies and significance of variants in unaffected individuals as defined above will need to be considered
- We expect to see hyperglycemia at birth in an individual with GCK-MODY and therefore consider an individual unaffected if euglycemic in childhood or adulthood
- Since individuals typically do not present with symptoms of diabetes, a statement that someone is "nondiabetic" is insufficient to classify a family member as unaffected
- Fasting glucose must be tested and found to be within normal limits (<100 mg/dl = 5.5 mmol/L) or HbA1c test <=5.5% since the GCK range was 5.6 - 7.6%
- Presence of clinically significant diabetes complications in anyone with the variant is an exclusion

#### PP1 Thresholds (Jarvik and Browning)

| Strength | Single Family | >1 Family |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Strong** | ≤ 1/32 (5 meioses) | ≤ 1/16 (4 meioses) |
| **Moderate** | ≤ 1/16 (4 meioses) | ≤ 1/8 (3 meioses) |
| **Supporting** | ≤ 1/8 (3 meioses) | ≤ 1/4 (2 meioses) |

---

### PP2 - Missense in Constrained Gene

**Original ACMG Summary:** Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.

**VCEP Specification (Supporting):**

Apply to **all missense variants in GCK**. gnomAD missense constraint score for GCK is 3.07 (observed/expected = 0.5), which is significant.

---

### PP3 - Computational Evidence

**Original ACMG Summary:** Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.).

**Caveat:** As many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion. PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.

**VCEP Specification (Supporting):**
- Use **REVEL score of ≥0.70** as supportive evidence of pathogenicity
- We also support using **SpliceAI** to assess the predicted impact of non-canonical splicing variants and synonymous variants: apply PP3 when the predicted change is **at least 0.2**

---

### PP4 - Phenotype Specificity

**Original ACMG Summary:** Patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

**VCEP Specifications:**
- Negative testing of other genes not necessary because phenotype is very specific
- Sixty percent of patients with GCK-MODY phenotype will test positive
- There is a small chance that patient has HNF1A- or HNF4A-MODY in the early stages of disease (can get info about likelihood from family history)
- Non-glycemic factors including hemoglobinopathies can affect HbA1c levels. This should be considered in cases where the HbA1c is outside the typical GCK range but fasting glucose and other features are consistent with GCK-hyperglycemia
- About 1% of patients with GCK-MODY will have deletions or other variants (e.g., promoter) that are not identified via Sanger sequencing - consider testing via NGS or other technology
- For patients tested because of neonatal diabetes, PP4 can be applied if there has been negative testing for three most common monogenic causes for neonatal diabetes: ABCC8, KCNJ11, and INS
- In consanguineous cases, EIF2AK3 should be tested as well

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate** | HbA1C 5.6-7.6% (38-60 mmol/mol) AND fasting plasma glucose (FPG) always 5.5-8 mmol/L (100-144 mg/dL) AND presence of any additional features (see below) |
| **Supporting** | HbA1C 5.6-7.6% (38-60 mmol/mol) AND fasting plasma glucose (FPG) always 5.5-8 mmol/L (100-144 mg/dL) |

**Additional Features for PP4_Moderate:**
- Pediatric patient (prepubertal or <10 years) picked up in the absence of symptoms, either incidentally during workup for an unrelated indication or during routine screening
- Multiple values (=persistent) of mild fasting hyperglycemia in PP4 range:
  - Either (≥1 HbA1c + ≥2 FPG) OR (≥2 HbA1c + ≥1 FPG)
  - Only 1 HbA1c and 1 FPG in range but they are at least 6 months apart
  - Patient in literature is described as having a multi-year history of impaired fasting glucose (IFG)
- OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) with 2-hour increment <3 mmol/L (54 mg/dl)
- Antibody negative
- Macrosomia in normoglycemic offspring of hyperglycemic gestational parent
- Low birthweight in hyperglycemic offspring of hyperglycemic gestational parent
- Three-generation, dominant family history of diabetes or hyperglycemia (in a family not used for PP1)

---

### PP5 - Reputable Source

**Original ACMG Summary:** Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation.

**VCEP Specifications:** *Not Applicable*

This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee. (PubMed: 29543229)

---

## Benign Criteria

### BA1 - Allele Frequency >5%

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is above 5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

**VCEP Specification (Stand Alone):**
- gnomAD Grpmax FAF **≥ 1:10,000** (≥ 0.01% or 0.0001)

---

### BS1 - Frequency Greater Than Expected

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.

**VCEP Specification (Strong):**
- gnomAD Grpmax FAF **≥ 1:25,000** (0.004% or 0.00004)

---

### BS2 - Observed in Healthy Adult

**Original ACMG Summary:** Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.

**VCEP Specification (Strong):**
- We expect to see hyperglycemia at birth in an individual with GCK-MODY and therefore consider an individual unaffected if euglycemic in childhood or adulthood
- Since individuals typically do not present with symptoms of diabetes, evidence that someone is "nondiabetic" is insufficient
- Fasting glucose must be tested and found to be within normal limits (<100 mg/dl / 5.5 mmol/L)

---

### BS3 - Functional Studies (No Effect)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.

**VCEP Specifications:**
- To use BS3, functional study must have been performed on a **transfected variant**
- If a study was performed on a cell line generated from a patient sample (and therefore contains the variant plus any other genomic variants the patient has) it cannot count as BS3
- Use GCK PS3/BS3 decision tree (see [Appendix E](#appendix-e-ps3bs3-decision-tree))

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Applicable to non-canonical splice site variants that have RNA and in silico evidence of **normal splicing** (see BP4) |
| **Supporting** | Normal RAI (>0.5) + normal RSI (>0.5) + normal inhibition/activation with GKRP/GKA = BS3_Supporting |

**Note:** Normal RAI (>0.5) + normal RSI (>0.5) but no studies investigating GKRP/GKA = **Cannot use PS3 or BS3**

---

### BS4 - Lack of Segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.

**Caveat:** The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e. cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.

**VCEP Specification (Strong):**

Applicable to family members without variant who meet PP4 criteria:
- HbA1C 5.6-7.6% (38-60 mmol/mol) (if given multiple results, use maximum value) AND
- Fasting glucose 5.5-8 mmol/L (100-144 mg/dL)

---

### BP1-BP7 - Benign Supporting

| Criterion | Status | Specification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **BP1** | *Not Applicable* | Missense variant in a gene for which primarily truncating variants are known to cause disease. |
| **BP2** | Supporting | Observed in trans with a pathogenic variant for a fully penetrant dominant gene/disorder or observed in cis with a pathogenic variant in any inheritance pattern. Also applicable when in cis or trans with a **likely pathogenic** variant. |
| **BP3** | *Not Applicable* | In-frame deletions/insertions in a repetitive region without a known function. |
| **BP4** | Supporting | Use a **REVEL score of ≤0.15** as supportive evidence of no predicted impact on the gene or gene product. We also support using **SpliceAI** to assess the predicted impact of non-canonical splicing variants and synonymous variants: apply BP4 when the predicted change is **below 0.2**. |
| **BP5** | Supporting | Variant found in a case with an alternate molecular basis for disease. A variant in another monogenic diabetes gene is P/LP. |
| **BP6** | *Not Applicable* | Reputable source recently reports variant as benign, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation. This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen SVI VCEP Review Committee. (PubMed: 29543229) |
| **BP7** | Supporting | A synonymous variant for which splicing prediction algorithms predict no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved. Apply BP7 when the predicted change from **SpliceAI is below 0.2** AND **phyloP100 way < 2.0**. |

---

## Rules for Combining Criteria

### Pathogenic Classification

| Criteria Combination |

## Appendices

**Appendix provenance:** Appendices A-E are source-derived editorial summaries, not complete transcriptions. Their controlling artifacts are, respectively, `GCK PVS1 Decision Tree.pdf`, `PS2 De Novo Points Table.pdf`, `GCK Points Table for PM3.pdf`, `GCK PM1 Residues.pdf`, and `GCK PS3_BS3 Decision tree.pdf`. Appendix F is a source-derived editorial convenience controlled by BA1, BS1, and PM2 in `ClinGen_ACMG_Specifications_GCK_v3.1.pdf`. Appendix G condenses that core PDF's References section; the core reference list controls. No appendix is an independent rule source.

### Appendix A: PVS1 Decision Tree

The supplied diagram is titled **GCK PVS1 Decision Tree (Adapted from PMID: 30192042)**.

*Source-derived editorial summary controlled by `GCK PVS1 Decision Tree.pdf`; it preserves the operative nodes, outcomes, markers, and connector topology but does not reproduce the diagram layout.*

#### Nonsense or Frameshift Variants
```
Nonsense or Frameshift
├── Predicted to undergo NMD (b) → PVS1
└── Not predicted to undergo NMD (b)
    └── Truncated/altered region is critical to protein function (c) → PVS1
```

#### GT--AG 1,2 Splice Site Variants
```
GT--AG 1,2 splice sites (a)
├── Exon skipping or use of cryptic splice site disrupts reading frame
│   ├── Predicted to undergo NMD (b) → PVS1
│   └── NOT predicted to undergo NMD (b)
│       └── Truncated/altered region is critical to protein function (c) → PVS1
└── Exon skipping or use of cryptic splice site preserves reading frame
    (exons 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10)
    └── Truncated/altered region is critical to protein function (c) → PVS1
```

#### Deletion Variants
```
Deletion (Single exon to full gene)
├── Full gene deletion → PVS1 (d)
├── Single to multi exon deletion
│   ├── Disrupts reading frame and predicted to undergo NMD (b) → PVS1
│   ├── Disrupts reading frame and NOT predicted to undergo NMD (b)
│   │   └── Truncated/altered region is critical to protein function (c) → PVS1
│   └── Preserves reading frame
│       └── Truncated/altered region is critical to protein function (c) → PVS1
```

**Marker (d) caveat:** Given that GCK is a known haploinsufficient gene, a pathogenic classification is warranted for a full gene deletion (in the absence of conflicting data), even though PVS1 alone would not reach a pathogenic classification using the combining rules in Richards et al. (2015).

#### Duplication Variants
```
Duplication (≥1 exon in size and must be completely contained within gene)
├── Proven in tandem
│   ├── Reading frame disrupted and NMD predicted to occur → PVS1
│   └── No or unknown impact on reading frame and NMD → N/A
├── Presumed in tandem
│   └── Reading frame presumed disrupted and NMD predicted to occur → PVS1_Strong
└── Proven not in tandem → N/A
```

#### Initiation Codon Variants
```
Initiation Codon
└── No known alternative start codon in other transcripts
    └── No pathogenic variant(s) upstream of closest potential in-frame start codon → PVS1_Supp
```

**Notes:**
- (a) This criterion should not be applied in combination with in silico splicing predictions (PP3). Additionally, splice site variants must have no detectable nearby (+/- 20 nts) strong consensus splice sequence that may reconstitute in-frame splicing.
- (b) NMD prediction based on the premature termination codon not occurring in the 3'-most exon or the 3'-most 50 bp of the penultimate exon.
- (c) Relevant domain indicated by experimental evidence proving a critical role of the domain and/or presence of non-truncating pathogenic variants in the region.
- (d) Given that GCK is a known haploinsufficient gene, a pathogenic classification is warranted for a full gene deletion in the absence of conflicting data, even though PVS1 alone would not reach pathogenic under Richards et al. (2015).

### Appendix E: PS3/BS3 Decision Tree

*Source-derived editorial summary controlled by `GCK PS3_BS3 Decision tree.pdf`. It preserves the operative labels, comparators, terminal outcomes, and connector topology but does not reproduce the diagram layout.*

#### Functional Study Requirements

**WT GCK kinetic parameters that must be met (including SEM):**
1. Kcat: 40-80

```
Ia = [ATP] / ([ATP] + Km) × Kcat / S0.5^h
RAI = Ia-MT / Ia-WT
```

        │   └── If not, recalculate; then calculate RAI
        │       └── RAI ≤ 0.5?
        │           ├── YES → PS3_Moderate

        │                   ├── YES → PS3_Supporting
        │                   └── NO → Does the variant impact interaction with GKRP and/or GKA?
        │                       ├── YES → PS3_Supporting
        │                       ├── NO → BS3_Supporting
