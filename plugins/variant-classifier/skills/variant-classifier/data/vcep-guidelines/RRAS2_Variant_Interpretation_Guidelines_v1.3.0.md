## Pathogenic Criteria

### PVS1 - Null Variant

**Original ACMG Summary:** Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical +/-1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease.

Caveats:
- Beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g. GFAP, MYH7).
- Use caution interpreting LOF variants at the extreme 3' end of a gene.
- Use caution with splice variants that are predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the protein intact.
- Use caution in the presence of multiple transcripts.

**VCEP Specifications:**

***Not Applicable***

**Comments:** Not applicable. The disease mechanism for RRAS2-associated RASopathy is gain-of-function, not loss-of-function.

---

### PS1 - Same Amino Acid Change

**Original ACMG Summary:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change. Example: Val->Leu caused by either G>C or G>T in the same codon. Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change. Applicable for observed analogous residue positions in *HRAS*, *KRAS*, *MRAS*, *NRAS*, *RIT1*, and *RRAS2*. | Analogous Gene |

---

### PS2 - De Novo (Confirmed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history. Note: Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, etc. can contribute to non-maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** Follow SVI recommendations for point-based scoring in conjunction with PM6 (see Reference 1) and phenotypic specifications: full points awarded with RASopathy phenotypes, reduced points applicable to cases with minimal phenotypic information (i.e. prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES)).

#### PS2/PM6 Point System (Per Proband)

| Phenotypic Consistency | Confirmed *de novo* (PS2) | Assumed *de novo* (PM6) |
|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Phenotype is consistent with a RASopathy* | 2 | 1 |
| Limited phenotypic information** | 1 | 0.5 |
| Phenotype not consistent with RASopathy | 0 | 0 |

\* Exclusive of prenatal cases

\*\* Applicable to prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES). Phenotypes for prenatal cases include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, increased nuchal translucency, cystic hygroma, or hydrops.

#### Evidence Strength Thresholds

The RRAS2 PDF body gives exact point values without comparator symbols: PS2 Very Strong 4, Strong 2, and Moderate 1; PM6 Strong 2, Moderate 1, and Supporting 0.5. The supplied `PS2_PM6 Scoring.jpg` extends the shared scale to all four strengths for either criterion, including PS2_Supporting and PM6_VeryStrong. Comparator semantics for this shared ladder are not stated.

| Points | Strength Level |
|--------|----------------|
| 0.5 | Supporting (PS2_Supporting or PM6_Supporting) |
| 1.0 | Moderate (PS2_Moderate or PM6) |
| 2.0 | Strong (PS2 or PM6_Strong) |
| 4.0 | Very Strong (PS2_VeryStrong or PM6_VeryStrong) |

| Strength | Points | Modification Type |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Very Strong** | 4 Points | Strength |
| **Strong** | 2 Points | None |
| **Moderate** | 1 Point | Strength |

---

### PS3 - Functional Studies

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product. Note: Functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well-established.

**VCEP Specifications:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product. Approved assays are available in the supplemental materials.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Moderate** | Two or more different approved assays. | Disease-specific, Gene-specific, Strength |
| **Supporting** | One approved assay. | Disease-specific, Gene-specific, Strength |

> **Note:** Prior to evaluation of an assay for a variant, all assays are expected to be validated by the performing laboratory in accordance with standard procedures with all appropriate control inclusions (PMID: 31892348) to enable accurate detection of abnormal and normal results. As most of these assays are semi-quantitative in nature, abnormal results should be compared relative to the known status of the controls included in the assay. Two or more unique assay types (i.e. RAS activation assay and MEK activation assay) for a given variant provides sufficient evidence to upgrade PS3 to the Moderate strength.

#### Approved Assay Instances for RRAS2

| Assay | General Description | Assay Specificity | Proposed Strength |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| **RAS Activation Assay** | Measures the bound RAS protein that immunoprecipitated with RAF1 or RBD (synthetic) | Pathway Specific: works for genes upstream from RAS and RAS proteins themselves but not for downstream components | PS3_Supporting; BS3_NA |
| **MEK Activation Assay** | Measures the ratio of phosphorylated MEK to unphosphorylated MEK, basally and following RTK stimulation | Pathway Specific | PS3_Supporting; BS3_NA |
| **ERK Activation Assay** | Measures the ratio of phosphorylated ERK to unphosphorylated ERK, basally and following stimulation | Pathway Specific | PS3_Supporting; BS3_NA |

### PS4 - Prevalence in Affected

**Original ACMG Summary:** The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls. Note 1: Relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR), as obtained from case-control studies, is >5.0 and the confidence interval around the estimate of RR or OR does not include 1.0. Note 2: In instances of very rare variants where case-control studies may not reach statistical significance, the prior observation of the variant in multiple unrelated patients with the same phenotype, and its absence in controls, may be used as moderate level of evidence.

**VCEP Specifications:** Strength adjustment using point-based scoring for autosomal dominant cases with phenotypic specifications: full points awarded with RASopathy phenotypes, reduced points applicable to cases with minimal phenotypic information (i.e. prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES)).

#### PS4 Point System (Per Proband)

| Phenotypic Consistency | Points per Proband |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Individual well-phenotyped with features of a RASopathy | 1 |
| Limited phenotypic information compatible with RASopathy* | 0.5 |
| No clinical information or isolated clinical features | 0 |
| Well-phenotyped but consistent with non-RASopathy disorder** | -1 |

\* Applicable to prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES). Phenotypes for prenatal cases include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, increased nuchal translucency, cystic hygroma, or hydrops.

\*\* Negative points for PS4 represent proband affected with a non-RASopathy congenital disorder rather than a healthy individual (BS2). This typically applies to probands tested by exome analysis with multiple other clinical features supporting a distinct syndromic disorder. (e.g. CHARGE, CdLS)

#### PS4 Evidence Strength Thresholds

| Points | Strength Level |
|--------|----------------|
| ≥1.0 | Supporting (PS4_Supporting) |
| ≥3.0 | Moderate (PS4_Moderate) |
| ≥5.0 | Strong (PS4) |

| Strength | Points | Modification Type |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | ≥5 points | Disease-specific |
| **Moderate** | ≥3 points | Strength |
| **Supporting** | ≥1 points | Strength |

---

### PM1 - Mutational Hot Spot

**Original ACMG Summary:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation.

**VCEP Specifications:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation. PM1 and PM5 may be used in conjunction at moderate levels, however, PM1 may not be applied if PM5_Strong is applied to avoid overweighting.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Moderate** | Applicable only to critical and well-established functional domains available in the supplementary table: **P-loop [AA 21-28]**, **SW1 [AA 36-51]**, **SW2 [AA 68-75]** (no SAK). Not applicable to specific amino acid residues (see PM5). | Gene-specific |

> **Note:** PM1 and PM5 may be used in conjunction at moderate levels. PM1 may **not** be applied if PM5_Strong is applied (to avoid overweighting).

#### RRAS2 Functional Domains

| Domain | RRAS2 Residues | HRAS Equivalent |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| P-loop | AA 21-28 | HRAS 10-17 |
| Switch I (SW1) | AA 36-51 | HRAS 25-40 |
| Switch II (SW2) | AA 68-75 | HRAS 57-64 |

---

### PM2 - Absent from Controls

**Original ACMG Summary:** Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium. Caveat: Population data for indels may be poorly called by next generation sequencing.

**VCEP Specification (Supporting only):**
- The variant must be absent from controls (gnomAD).

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Supporting** | The variant must be absent from controls (gnomAD). | Strength |

---

### PM3 - In Trans with Pathogenic

**Original ACMG Summary:** For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant. Note: This requires testing of parents (or offspring) to determine phase.

**VCEP Specifications:**

***Not Applicable***

**Comments:** Not applicable. RRAS2-associated RASopathy follows autosomal dominant inheritance.

---

### PM4 - Protein Length Changes

**Original ACMG Summary:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

**VCEP Specifications:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Moderate** | No known repetitive areas in gene. Use as described. | General recommendation |

---

### PM5 - Novel Missense at Same Residue

**Original ACMG Summary:** Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before. Example: Arg156His is pathogenic; now you observe Arg156Cys. Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:** Applicable for observed analogous residue positions in *HRAS*, *KRAS*, *MRAS*, *NRAS*, *RIT1*, and *RRAS2*. PM1 and PM5 may be used in conjunction at moderate levels, however, PM1 may not be applied if PM5_Strong is applied to avoid overweighting.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | ≥2 different [likely] pathogenic “residues changes” at the same codon observed in ≥5 probands. | Analogous Gene, Strength |
| **Moderate** | 1 [likely] pathogenic residue change at the same codon. | Analogous Gene, Disease-specific |

> **Note:** PM1 and PM5 may be used in conjunction at moderate levels. PM1 may **not** be applied if PM5_Strong is applied (to avoid overweighting).

> **Source wording:** “residues changes” is preserved from the PDF and appears to be a grammatical typo.

---

### PM6 - De Novo (Assumed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** Follow SVI recommendations for point-based scoring in conjunction with PS2 (see Reference 1) and phenotypic specifications: full points awarded with RASopathy phenotypes, reduced points applicable to cases with minimal phenotypic information (i.e. prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES)).

Same as PS2 - use point-based system above (see [PS2/PM6 Point System](#ps2pm6-point-system-per-proband)).

| Strength | Points | Modification Type |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | 2 Points | Strength |
| **Moderate** | 1 Point | None |
| **Supporting** | 0.5 Points | Strength |

The supplied scoring image additionally shows **PM6_VeryStrong at 4 points**. This strength is absent from the PM6 rows in the PDF body but present in the VCEP-distributed supplement.

---

### PP1 - Co-segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease. Note: May be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data.

**VCEP Specifications:** Segregation in more than one family is recommended.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | ≥7 informative meioses | Strength |
| **Moderate** | ≥5 informative meioses | Strength |
| **Supporting** | ≥3 informative meioses | Disease-specific |

---

### PP2 - Missense in Constrained Gene

**Original ACMG Summary:** Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.

**VCEP Specifications:**

***Not Applicable***

**Comments:** Not applicable because missense z score is <3.09 in gnomAD.

---

### PP3 - Computational Evidence

**Original ACMG Summary:** Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.). Caveat: As many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion. PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.

**VCEP Specifications:** For missense variants: REVEL ≥ 0.7. For splicing impact, predicted outcome must match disease mechanism.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Supporting** | For missense variants: REVEL ≥ 0.7. For splicing impact, predicted outcome must match disease mechanism. | Disease-specific |

---

### PP4 - Phenotype Specificity

**Original ACMG Summary:** Patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

**VCEP Specifications:**

***Not Applicable***

**Comments:** Not applicable, see PS4.

---

### PP5 - Reputable Source

**Original ACMG Summary:** Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation.

**VCEP Specifications:**

***Not Applicable***

This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee. (PubMed: 29543229)

---

## Benign Criteria

### BA1 - Allele Frequency >5%

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is above 5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

**VCEP Specification (Stand Alone):**
- gnomAD filtering allele frequency **≥0.05%**

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Stand Alone** | gnomAD filtering allele frequency ≥0.05% | Disease-specific |

---

### BS1 - Frequency Greater Than Expected

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.

**VCEP Specification (Strong):**
- gnomAD filtering allele frequency **≥0.025%**

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | gnomAD filtering allele frequency ≥0.025% | Disease-specific |

---

### BS2 - Observed in Healthy Adult

**Original ACMG Summary:** Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.

**VCEP Specifications:** Strength adjustment using point-based scoring based on phenotypic specifications. Phenotypic specifications: based on healthy homozygote or heterozygote individuals, reduced points for apparently unaffected heterozygous individuals, applicable to parent or sibling samples during clinical family evaluations.

#### BS2 Point System (Per Individual)

| Phenotypic Consistency | Points per Individual |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Healthy homozygous individual assessed for a RASopathy | -3 |
| Healthy heterozygous individual assessed for a RASopathy | -1 |
| No phenotypic information other than "unaffected" heterozygote* | -0.25 |
| No clinical information or nonspecific clinical features | 0 |

\* Typically applicable to parental or sibling samples during clinical family evaluations.

#### BS2 Evidence Strength Thresholds

> **Source contradiction — do not resolve silently:** The PDF body assigns **BS2 Strong at -4 points** and **BS2 Supporting at -1 point**, with no comparator symbols. The VCEP-distributed `BS2 Scoring.jpg` instead assigns **BS2 Strong at -3 points**, Supporting at -1, and says Moderate is unavailable. The image states exact values without operators.

| Points | Strength Level |
|--------|----------------|
| -1 | Supporting (BS2_Supporting) |
| N/A | Moderate (not used) |
| -3.0 | Strong (BS2) |

| Strength | Points | Modification Type |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | -4 Points | Strength |
| **Supporting** | -1 Point | Strength |

---

### BS3 - Functional Studies (No Effect)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.

**VCEP Specifications (verbatim):** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a **damaging** effect on the gene or gene product. Approved assays are available in the supplemental materials.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Supporting** | Assays approved by the VCEP sufficiently evaluate the functional impact of a given variant for the application of `PS3_Supporting`. | Disease-specific, Strength |

> **Source contradiction — do not operationalize a resolution:** This text appears under BS3 (“no damaging effect”) but instead specifies a damaging effect and explicitly names `PS3_Supporting`. The classification-combination rules nevertheless include `BS3_Supporting` as benign evidence. The distributed functional workbook marks every approved RRAS2 assay `PS3_Supporting; BS3_NA`. The prior guideline silently changed “damaging” to “no damaging” and asserted that normal results provide BS3_Supporting; that reconciliation has been removed.

---

### BS4 - Lack of Segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family. Caveat: The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e. cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.

**VCEP Specifications:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | Requires only one informative meiosis. | General recommendation |

---

### BP1-BP7 - Benign Supporting

| Criterion | Status | Specification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **BP1** | Applicable (Modified) | Truncating, LOF variant in a gene for which primarily missense, GOF variants are known to cause disease. This rule has contraindications for use with RASopathies. Given the disease mechanism is gain-of-function, BP1 should be used for any truncating variant (nonsense, frameshift, affects canonical splice sites, initiation codon, entire gene or multi-exon deletion) in genes without established LOF correlation to disease. See supplemental material regarding dosage sensitivity for RRAS2. |
| **BP2** | Applicable (Modified, Point-based) | Points are awarded for an alternative molecular cause of a RASopathy in the **same gene** (and/or in conjunction with BP5) and the phenotype is consistent with expected severity of the RASopathy. |
| **BP3** | Not Applicable | No known benign repetitive areas in RASopathy genes. |
| **BP4** | Applicable | For missense variants: REVEL ≤0.3. For splicing variants: predicted outcome is negligible or does not match disease mechanism. |
| **BP5** | Applicable (Modified, Point-based) | Points are awarded for an alternative molecular cause of a RASopathy in a **different gene** (and/or in conjunction with BP2) and the phenotype is consistent with expected severity of the RASopathy. Points are also awarded for phenotypes inconsistent with a RASopathy and fully explained by a different causative variant (e.g. WES testing). |
| **BP6** | Not Applicable | This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen SVI VCEP Review Committee. (PubMed: 29543229) |
| **BP7** | Applicable | A synonymous (silent) variant for which splicing prediction algorithms predict no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved. Also applicable for intronic positions (except canonical splice sites) or non-coding variants. Should be used in conjunction with BP4. |

> **Missing distributed content:** BP1 cites supplemental dosage-sensitivity information for RRAS2, but the package contains no dosage-sensitivity file. The analogous-residue PDF, functional workbook, and scoring images do not supply it.

#### BP5/BP2 Point System (Per Individual)

| Phenotypic Consistency | Points per Individual |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Phenotype inconsistent with a RASopathy and causative variant has been identified, **-or-** Molecular cause of a RASopathy is identified in a different RASopathy gene, **-or-** Molecular cause of a RASopathy is identified in *trans* or *cis* with the variant being classified | -1 |
| Phenotype inconsistent with a RASopathy and no causative variant identified/reported | 0 |

#### BP5/BP2 Evidence Strength Thresholds

> **Source contradiction — do not resolve silently:** The PDF body assigns Strong at **≥(-4)**, Moderate at **≥(-2)**, and Supporting at **≥(-1)** for both BP2 and BP5. The VCEP-distributed `BP5_BP2 Scoring.jpg` instead assigns Strong at **-3**, says Moderate is **N/A**, and assigns Supporting at **-1**. The image states exact values without comparator symbols.

| Points | Strength Level |
|--------|----------------|
| -1 | Supporting (BP5/BP2) |
| N/A | Moderate (not used) |
| -3.0 | Strong (BP5_Strong/BP2_Strong) |

#### BP2 Strength Levels

| Strength | Points | Modification Type |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | ≥ (-4) Points | Strength |
| **Moderate** | ≥ (-2) Points | Strength |
| **Supporting** | ≥ (-1) Point | None |

#### BP5 Strength Levels

| Strength | Points | Modification Type |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | ≥ (-4) Points | Strength |
| **Moderate** | ≥ (-2) Points | Strength |
| **Supporting** | ≥ (-1) Point | None |

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Analogous Residue Positions

The following proteins are used for analogous residue comparisons (applicable to PS1 and PM5):

| Gene | RefSeq Protein | P-loop | Switch I | Switch II |
|------|---------------|--------|----------|-----------|
| HRAS | NP_005334.1 | AA 10-17 | AA 25-40 | AA 57-64 |
| KRAS | NP_004976.2 | AA 10-17 | AA 25-40 | AA 57-64 |
| MRAS | NP_036351.3 | AA 20-27 | AA 35-50 | AA 67-74 |
| NRAS | NP_002515.1 | AA 10-17 | AA 25-40 | AA 57-64 |
| RIT1 | NP_008843.1 | AA 28-35 | AA 43-58 | AA 75-82 |
| **RRAS2** | **NP_036382.2** | **AA 21-28** | **AA 36-51** | **AA 68-75** |

> **Provenance:** `Analogous Residues.pdf` provides these relationships as two image alignments, not an exhaustive discrete residue-pair table. The RRAS2 ranges are also stated directly in the main PDF; do not infer unprinted mappings beyond the alignment.

### Appendix B: Approved Functional Assays Summary

| Assay | Applicable to RRAS2 | Workbook strength |
|-------|:-------------------:|-------------------|
| RAS Activation Assay | Yes | PS3_Supporting; BS3_NA |
| MEK Activation Assay | Yes | PS3_Supporting; BS3_NA |
| ERK Activation Assay | Yes | PS3_Supporting; BS3_NA |

> **Note:** Animal models and variant-specific assays (e.g. myristoylation assays) have been excluded as the assays above are considered the most appropriate to evaluate variant pathogenicity for all genes. Assays not listed here are presumed to lack sufficient historical evidence and may only be sufficient for PS3_Supporting or BS3_Supporting.

### Appendix C: Population Frequency Thresholds Summary

| Criterion | Threshold | Strength |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| BA1 | ≥0.05% (gnomAD FAF) | Stand Alone |
| BS1 | ≥0.025% (gnomAD FAF) | Strong |
| PM2 | Absent from gnomAD | Supporting |

| BS4 | Applicable | Strong |
| BP1 | Applicable (Modified) | Supporting |
| BP2 | Applicable (Point-based) | Strong |
| BP3 | Not Applicable | - |
| BP4 | Applicable | Supporting |

## Version History

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| 1.3.0 | 12/3/2024 | "Observed in ≥5 probands" removed from PM5 at Moderate strength. Pilot variants included in the LZTR1 submission. |
| 1.0.0 | Initial | Initial ACMG/AMP variant classification specifications developed by the RASopathy VCEP. |

**Document corrections (2026-08-07), source-verified against `ClinGen_ACMG_Specifications_RRAS2_v1.3.pdf`, `Analogous Residues.pdf`, `Approved Functional Studies.xlsx`, `PS2_PM6 Scoring.jpg`, `PS4 Scoring.jpg`, `BP5_BP2 Scoring.jpg`, and `BS2 Scoring.jpg`. No change to the underlying ClinGen specification version.**

- **BS3 silent reconciliation removed:** the PDF's BS3 block assigns Supporting but describes a *damaging* effect and explicitly says `PS3_Supporting`; its combining rules nevertheless use `BS3_Supporting`. The workbook marks all three RRAS2 assays `BS3_NA`. The prior guideline changed the text to “no damaging effect” and asserted normal results support BS3. All source readings are now reported without choosing one.
- **Shared scoring contradictions restored:** BS2 is -4 in the PDF body versus -3 in its image; BP2/BP5 use PDF tiers ≥(-4)/≥(-2)/≥(-1) versus image tiers -3/N/A/-1. The image's operators remain unstated.
- **Functional qualifiers completed:** DOIs, absence of statistical analyses, and the absence-only ClinVar/gnomAD statuses used in validation-control rows are now recorded. Appendix B no longer makes false “all RASopathy genes” claims and is limited to RRAS2's actual approved columns.
- **Supplement provenance qualified:** the analogous-residue file contains image alignments, not an exhaustive pairwise lookup table.
- **Supplement-only strengths and source typo identified:** the shared image adds PS2_Supporting and PM6_VeryStrong to criterion blocks that omit them; PM6's summary maximum was corrected accordingly. The PDF's “residues changes” typo is preserved and flagged.
- **Missing BP1 content recorded:** no dosage-sensitivity supplement is distributed for RRAS2.
