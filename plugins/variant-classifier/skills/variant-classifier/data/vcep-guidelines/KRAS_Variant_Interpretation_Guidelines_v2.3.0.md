## Pathogenic Criteria

### PVS1 - Null Variant

**Original ACMG Summary:** Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical +/-1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease.

**Caveats:**
- Beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g. GFAP, MYH7)
- Use caution interpreting LOF variants at the extreme 3' end of a gene
- Use caution with splice variants that are predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the protein intact
- Use caution in the presence of multiple transcripts

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

> **Comment:** Not applicable. The VCEP does not provide a KRAS-specific rationale in the PVS1 row. Its BP1 specification describes the RASopathy mechanism as gain-of-function and directs BP1 use for truncating variants in genes without an established loss-of-function disease correlation.

---

### PS1 - Same Amino Acid Change

**Original ACMG Summary:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.

**VCEP Specifications:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change. Applicable for observed analogous residue positions in *HRAS*, *KRAS*, *MRAS*, *NRAS*, *RIT1*, and *RRAS2*. | Analogous Gene |

> **Note:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

---

### PS2 - De Novo (Confirmed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history.

**VCEP Specifications:** Follow SVI recommendations for point-based scoring in conjunction with PM6 (see Reference 1) and phenotypic specifications: full points awarded with RASopathy phenotypes, reduced points applicable to cases with minimal phenotypic information (i.e. prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES)).

#### PS2/PM6 Point System

| Phenotypic Consistency | Confirmed *de novo* (PS2) | Assumed *de novo* (PM6) |
|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Phenotype is consistent with a RASopathy* | 2 points | 1 point |
| Limited phenotypic information** | 1 point | 0.5 points |
| Phenotype not consistent with RASopathy | 0 points | 0 points |

*\*Exclusive of prenatal cases*

*\*\*Applicable to prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES). Phenotypes for prenatal cases include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, increased nuchal translucency, cystic hygroma, or hydrops.*

#### Strength Ladder in `PS2_PM6 Scoring.jpg`

The image prints exact totals without inequality comparators:

| Strength Level | Points Required |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Supporting** (PS2_Supporting or PM6_Supporting) | 0.5 points |
| **Moderate** (PS2_Moderate or PM6) | 1 point |
| **Strong** (PS2 or PM6_Strong) | 2 points |
| **Very Strong** (PS2_VeryStrong or PM6_VeryStrong) | 4 points |

#### Strength Levels in the Main PDF

| Criterion | Published strengths and point totals |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| **PS2** | Very Strong: 4; Strong: 2; Moderate: 1 |
| **PM6** | Strong: 2; Moderate: 1; Supporting: 0.5 |

The main PDF also prints bare totals without inequality comparators.

> **SOURCE CONTRADICTION / OMISSION — do not silently resolve:** the scoring image defines `PS2_Supporting` at 0.5 point and `PM6_VeryStrong` at 4 points, but those strengths are absent from the main PDF's PS2 and PM6 strength rows. The image-only tiers remain identified as such; do not infer `>=` for any of these bare totals.

---

### PS3 - Functional Studies

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product.

**VCEP Specifications:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product. Approved assays are available in the supplemental materials.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Moderate** | Two or more different approved assays | Disease-specific, Gene-specific, Strength |
| **Supporting** | One approved assay | Disease-specific, Gene-specific, Strength |

The workbook requires performing laboratories to validate assays with appropriate controls (PMID 31892348). It treats RAS, MEK, and ERK assays as pathway-specific, so controls from any gene may support abnormal pathway function. Unlisted assays may be sufficient only for PS3_Supporting/BS3_Supporting; animal models and variant-specific assays are excluded. Two or more unique approved assay types for the same variant support PS3_Moderate.

> **SOURCE QUALITY WARNING — do not silently repair:** `Approved Functional Studies.xlsx` marks all three assays approved (`Y`) despite recording biological replicates, the basic negative control, and statistical analysis as not met/not present. Its B/LB-control fields contain only variants labelled `P` for the RAS and ERK assays, while MEK says `None`; several P/LP fields include `VUS`. These values are transcribed exactly. They are source-level inconsistencies, not permission to relabel controls or withdraw the VCEP's published approval.

---

### PS4 - Prevalence in Affected

**Original ACMG Summary:** The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls.

**VCEP Specifications:** Strength adjustment using point-based scoring for autosomal dominant cases with phenotypic specifications: full points awarded with RASopathy phenotypes, reduced points applicable to cases with minimal phenotypic information (i.e. prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES)).

#### PS4 Point System

| Phenotypic Consistency | Points per Proband |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Individual well-phenotyped with features of a RASopathy | 1 |
| Limited phenotypic information compatible with RASopathy* | 0.5 |
| No clinical information or isolated clinical features | 0 |
| Well-phenotyped but consistent with non-RASopathy disorder** | -1 |

*\*Applicable to prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES). Phenotypes for prenatal cases include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, increased nuchal translucency, cystic hygroma, or hydrops.*

*\*\*Negative points for PS4 represent proband affected with a non-RASopathy congenital disorder rather than a healthy individual (BS2). This typically applies to probands tested by exome analysis with multiple other clinical features supporting a distinct syndromic disorder. (e.g. CHARGE, CdLS)*

#### PS4 Main-PDF Strength Thresholds

The main PDF explicitly uses inclusive `>=` comparators. The scoring image's footer instead prints exact totals of 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 without operators.

| Strength Level | Points Required |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Supporting** (PS4_Supporting) | ≥1 points |
| **Moderate** (PS4_Moderate) | ≥3 points |
| **Strong** (PS4) | ≥5 points |

**Source typo preserved:** the main PDF prints “≥1 points.”

---

### PM1 - Mutational Hot Spot

**Original ACMG Summary:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation.

**VCEP Specifications:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation. PM1 and PM5 may be used in conjunction at moderate levels, however, PM1 may not be applied if PM5_Strong is applied to avoid overweighting.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Moderate** | Applicable only to critical and well-established functional domains available in the supplementary table. Not applicable to specific amino acid residues (see PM5). | Gene-specific |

#### Critical Functional Domains for KRAS

| Domain | Amino Acid Positions |
|--------|---------------------|
| **P-loop** | AA 10-17 |
| **Switch I (SW1)** | AA 25-40 |
| **Switch II (SW2)** | AA 57-64 |
| **SAK** | AA 145-156 |

> **Note:** PM1 and PM5 may be used in conjunction at moderate levels, however, PM1 may not be applied if PM5_Strong is applied to avoid overweighting.

---

### PM2 - Absent from Controls

**Original ACMG Summary:** Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

**VCEP Specification (Supporting only):**

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Supporting** | The variant must be absent from controls (gnomAD) | Strength |

> **Caveat:** Population data for indels may be poorly called by next generation sequencing.

---

### PM3 - In Trans with Pathogenic

**Original ACMG Summary:** For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant.

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

> **Comment:** Not applicable. KRAS-associated RASopathies follow autosomal dominant inheritance.

---

### PM4 - Protein Length Changes

**Original ACMG Summary:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

**VCEP Specifications:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Moderate** | No known repetitive areas in gene. Use as described. | General recommendation |

---

### PM5 - Novel Missense at Same Residue

**Original ACMG Summary:** Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before.

**VCEP Specifications:** Applicable for observed analogous residue positions in *HRAS*, *KRAS*, *MRAS*, *NRAS*, *RIT1*, and *RRAS2*. PM1 and PM5 may be used in conjunction at moderate levels, however, PM1 may not be applied if PM5_Strong is applied to avoid overweighting.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | ≥2 different [likely] pathogenic residues changes at the same codon observed in ≥5 probands | Analogous Gene, Strength |
| **Moderate** | 1 [likely] pathogenic residue change at the same codon | Analogous Gene, Disease-specific |

> **Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**Source typo preserved:** the Strong row prints “residues changes.”

---

### PM6 - De Novo (Assumed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** Follow SVI recommendations for point-based scoring in conjunction with PS2 (see Reference 1) and phenotypic specifications: full points awarded with RASopathy phenotypes, reduced points applicable to cases with minimal phenotypic information (i.e. prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES)).

| Strength | Criteria | Points |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Strong** | PM6_Strong | 2 points |
| **Moderate** | PM6 | 1 point |
| **Supporting** | PM6_Supporting | 0.5 points |

> **Note:** See PS2 section for the complete point-based scoring system.

`PS2_PM6 Scoring.jpg` additionally publishes `PM6_VeryStrong` at exactly 4 points; the main PDF has no PM6 Very Strong row. See the source warning under PS2.

---

### PP1 - Co-segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease.

**VCEP Specifications:** Segregation in more than one family is recommended.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | ≥7 informative meioses | Strength |
| **Moderate** | ≥5 informative meioses | Strength |
| **Supporting** | ≥3 informative meioses | Disease-specific |

---

### PP2 - Missense in Constrained Gene

**Original ACMG Summary:** Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

> **Comment:** Not applicable because missense z score is <3.09 in gnomAD.

---

### PP3 - Computational Evidence

**Original ACMG Summary:** Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.).

**VCEP Specifications:**

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Supporting** | For missense variants: REVEL ≥ 0.7. For splicing impact, predicted outcome must match disease mechanism. | Disease-specific |

> **Caveat:** As many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion. PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.

---

### PP4 - Phenotype Specificity

**Original ACMG Summary:** Patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

> **Comment:** Not applicable, see PS4.

---

### PP5 - Reputable Source

**Original ACMG Summary:** Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation.

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

> This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee (PubMed: 29543229).

---

## Benign Criteria

### BA1 - Allele Frequency >5%

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is above 5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

**VCEP Specification (Stand Alone):**

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Stand Alone** | gnomAD filtering allele frequency ≥0.05% | Disease-specific |

---

### BS1 - Frequency Greater Than Expected

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.

**VCEP Specification (Strong):**

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | gnomAD filtering allele frequency ≥0.025% | Disease-specific |

---

### BS2 - Observed in Healthy Adult

**Original ACMG Summary:** Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.

**VCEP Specifications:** Strength adjustment using point-based scoring based on phenotypic specifications. Phenotypic specifications: based on healthy homozygote or heterozygote individuals, reduced points for apparently unaffected heterozygous individuals, applicable to parent or sibling samples during clinical family evaluations.

#### BS2 Point System

| Phenotypic Consistency | Points per Individual |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Healthy homozygous individual assessed for a RASopathy | -3 |
| Healthy heterozygous individual assessed for a RASopathy | -1 |
| No phenotypic information other than "unaffected" heterozygote* | -0.25 |
| No clinical information or nonspecific clinical features | 0 |

*\*Typically applicable to parental or sibling samples during clinical family evaluations.*

#### BS2 Strength Ladder in `BS2 Scoring.jpg`

The image prints exact totals without inequality comparators:

| Strength Level | Points Required |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Supporting** (BS2_Supporting) | -1 points |
| **Moderate** | N/A |
| **Strong** (BS2) | -3.0 points |

#### BS2 Strength Levels in the Main PDF

| Strength | Published point total |
|----------|-----------------------|
| **Strong** | -4 points |
| **Supporting** | -1 point |

Neither main-PDF total carries an inequality comparator.

> **SOURCE CONTRADICTION — do not silently resolve:** BS2 Strong is **-4 points** in the main PDF but **-3.0 points** in `BS2 Scoring.jpg`. Both sources give Supporting at -1 point. No single operative Strong threshold can be selected from the distributed package.

---

### BS3 - Functional Studies (No Effect)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

> **Comment:** The main PDF marks BS3 Not Applicable and says approved studies are available in supplemental material. Every KRAS assay column in `Approved Functional Studies.xlsx` explicitly records `BS3_NA`; additional studies may be submitted to the panel.

---

### BS4 - Lack of Segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.

**VCEP Specifications:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.

| Strength | Criteria | Modification Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | Requires only one informative meiosis | General recommendation |

> **Caveat:** The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e. cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.

---

### BP1-BP7 - Benign Supporting

| Criterion | Status | Specification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **BP1** | Modified | Truncating, LOF variant in a gene for which primarily missense, GOF variants are known to cause disease. This rule has contraindications for use with RASopathies. Given the disease mechanism is gain-of-function for RASopathies, BP1 should be used for any truncating variant (nonsense, frameshift, affects canonical splice sites, initiation codon, entire gene or multi-exon deletion) in genes without established LOF correlation to disease. The source refers to supplemental dosage-sensitivity and LoF-disorder information, but the distributed KRAS supplements do not contain it. |
| **BP2** | Modified (Point-based) | Points are awarded for an alternative molecular cause of a RASopathy in the same gene (and/or in conjunction with BP5) and the phenotype is consistent with expected severity of the RASopathy. **Supporting:** ≥(-1) Point; **Moderate:** ≥(-2) Points; **Strong:** ≥(-4) Points |
| **BP3** | Not Applicable | No known benign repetitive areas in RASopathy genes. |
| **BP4** | Modified | For missense variants: REVEL ≤0.3. For splicing variants: predicted outcome is negligible or does not match disease mechanism. |
| **BP5** | Modified (Point-based) | Points are awarded for an alternative molecular cause of a RASopathy in a different gene (and/or in conjunction with BP2) and the phenotype is consistent with expected severity of the RASopathy. Points are also awarded for phenotypes inconsistent with a RASopathy and fully explained by a different causative variant (e.g. WES testing). **Supporting:** ≥(-1) Point; **Moderate:** ≥(-2) Points; **Strong:** ≥(-4) Points |
| **BP6** | Not Applicable | This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee (PubMed: 29543229). |
| **BP7** | Modified | A synonymous (silent) variant for which splicing prediction algorithms predict no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved. This rule is also applicable for intronic positions (except canonical splice sites) or non-coding variants and should be used in conjunction with BP4. |

> **MISSING DISTRIBUTED MATERIAL:** BP1 directs the reader to gene-specific dosage-sensitivity information and possible disorders associated with loss-of-function variants. `Analogous Residues.pdf`, `Approved Functional Studies.xlsx`, and the four scoring images contain no KRAS dosage-sensitivity information. Do not infer or substitute generic ACMG/AMP content.

**BP4 source wording note:** the VCEP summary includes missense (`REVEL <=0.3`, inclusive) and splicing (negligible predicted effect or outcome not matching disease mechanism), but the strength-specific Supporting row repeats only the missense rule. Both published statements are retained; the omission is not interpreted as withdrawal of the splicing rule.

#### BP5/BP2 Point System

| Phenotypic Consistency | Points per Individual |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Phenotype inconsistent with a RASopathy and causative variant has been identified, -or- Molecular cause of a RASopathy is identified in a different RASopathy gene, -or- Molecular cause of a RASopathy is identified in *trans* or *cis* with the variant being classified | -1 |
| Phenotype inconsistent with a RASopathy and no causative variant identified/reported | 0 |

#### BP5/BP2 Strength Ladder in `BP5_BP2 Scoring.jpg`

The image prints exact totals without inequality comparators:

| Strength Level | Points Required |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Supporting** (BP5/BP2) | -1 points |
| **Moderate** | N/A |
| **Strong** (BP5_Strong/BP2_Strong) | -3.0 points |

> **SOURCE CONTRADICTION — do not silently resolve:** the main PDF publishes BP2 and BP5 as Strong at `>= (-4)`, Moderate at `>= (-2)`, and Supporting at `>= (-1)`. `BP5_BP2 Scoring.jpg` instead publishes Strong at exactly -3.0, Moderate as N/A, and Supporting at exactly -1. The PDF's printed `>=` direction on a negative-point scale would also let less-negative totals satisfy stronger thresholds. Both presentations remain verbatim; no operative tier is selected here.

| 1 Strong (PS1, PS2, PS4, PM5_Strong, PM6_Strong, PP1_Strong) **AND** 2 Moderate (PS2_Moderate, PS4_Moderate, PM1, PM4, PM5, PM6, PP1_Moderate) **AND** ≥2 Supporting (PS3_Supporting, PS4_Supporting, PM2_Supporting, PM6_Supporting, PP1, PP3) |
| 1 Strong (PS1, PS2, PS4, PM5_Strong, PM6_Strong, PP1_Strong) **AND** 1 Moderate (PS2_Moderate, PS4_Moderate, PM1, PM4, PM5, PM6, PP1_Moderate) **AND** ≥4 Supporting (PS3_Supporting, PS4_Supporting, PM2_Supporting, PM6_Supporting, PP1, PP3) |

### Likely Pathogenic Classification

| Criteria Combination |
|---------------------|
| 1 Very Strong (PS2_Very Strong) **AND** 1 Moderate (PS2_Moderate, PS4_Moderate, PM1, PM4, PM5, PM6, PP1_Moderate) |
| 1 Strong (PS1, PS2, PS4, PM5_Strong, PM6_Strong, PP1_Strong) **AND** 1 Moderate (PS2_Moderate, PS4_Moderate, PM1, PM4, PM5, PM6, PP1_Moderate) |
| 1 Strong (PS1, PS2, PS4, PM5_Strong, PM6_Strong, PP1_Strong) **AND** ≥2 Supporting (PS3_Supporting, PS4_Supporting, PM2_Supporting, PM6_Supporting, PP1, PP3) |
| ≥3 Moderate (PS2_Moderate, PS4_Moderate, PM1, PM4, PM5, PM6, PP1_Moderate) |
| 2 Moderate (PS2_Moderate, PS4_Moderate, PM1, PM4, PM5, PM6, PP1_Moderate) **AND** ≥2 Supporting (PS3_Supporting, PS4_Supporting, PM2_Supporting, PM6_Supporting, PP1, PP3) |
| 1 Moderate (PS2_Moderate, PS4_Moderate, PM1, PM4, PM5, PM6, PP1_Moderate) **AND** ≥4 Supporting (PS3_Supporting, PS4_Supporting, PM2_Supporting, PM6_Supporting, PP1, PP3) |

### Benign Classification

| Criteria Combination |
|---------------------|
| ≥2 Strong (BS1, BS2, BS4, BP2_Strong, BP5_Strong) |
| 1 Stand Alone (BA1) |

### Likely Benign Classification

| Criteria Combination |
|---------------------|
| 1 Strong (BS1, BS2, BS4, BP2_Strong, BP5_Strong) **AND** 1 Supporting (BS2_Supporting, BP1, BP2, BP4, BP5, BP7) |
| ≥2 Supporting (BS2_Supporting, BP1, BP2, BP4, BP5, BP7) |
| 1 Strong (BS1, BS2, BS4, BP2_Strong, BP5_Strong) |
| 1 Strong (BS1) |

**Published-rule tensions:** the combination tables list `PS3_Supporting` but omit the separately defined `PS3_Moderate`. They list BP2/BP5 at Supporting and Strong but not Moderate, although the main criterion rows define Moderate and the image marks it N/A. The tables above remain as published; these conflicts are not harmonized.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Critical Functional Domains

| Domain | KRAS Positions |
|--------|---------------|
| **P-loop** | AA 10-17 |
| **Switch I (SW1)** | AA 25-40 |
| **Switch II (SW2)** | AA 57-64 |
| **SAK** | AA 145-156 |

The previous descriptive labels were removed because neither the main PDF nor `Analogous Residues.pdf` defines them. The VCEP supplies only the names and ranges above.

### Appendix B: Analogous Residue Alignment

The following genes have analogous residue positions that can be used for PS1 and PM5 criteria:
- HRAS
- KRAS
- MRAS
- NRAS
- RIT1
- RRAS2

Reference sequences:
| Gene | RefSeq Protein | RefSeq Transcript |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| HRAS | NP_005334.1 | - |
| KRAS | NP_004976.2 | NM_004985.5 |
| MRAS | NP_036351.3 | - |
| NRAS | NP_002515.1 | - |
| RIT1 | NP_008843.1 | - |
| RRAS2 | NP_036382.2 | - |

`Analogous Residues.pdf` contains two image-based whole-protein alignments, not a discrete exhaustive residue-pair lookup table. It highlights HRAS-anchored P-loop (10–17), Switch I (25–40), Switch II (57–64), and SAK (145–156) regions. KRAS NP_004976.2 is co-numbered with HRAS for those four ranges. For other individual analogous residues, consult the distributed alignment itself rather than inferring a mapping from the domain boundaries.

### Appendix C: Population Frequency Thresholds Summary

| Criterion | Threshold | Strength |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| BA1 | ≥0.05% (gnomAD FAF) | Stand Alone |
| BS1 | ≥0.025% (gnomAD FAF) | Strong |
| PM2 | Absent from gnomAD | Supporting |

### Appendix D: Computational Predictor Thresholds

| Predictor | Pathogenic Threshold (PP3) | Benign Threshold (BP4) |
|-----------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| REVEL | ≥0.7 | ≤0.3 |

## Version History

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| 2.3.0 | 12/3/2024 | Submitting Pilot Rules. All pilot variants are attached in the LZTR1 submission. "Observed in ≥5 probands" removed from PM5 at Moderate strength. |

**Document corrections (2026-08-07), source-verified against `ClinGen_ACMG_Specifications_KRAS_v2.3.pdf`, both rendered pages of `Analogous Residues.pdf`, every worksheet (including hidden sheets) in `Approved Functional Studies.xlsx`, `PS2_PM6 Scoring.jpg`, `PS4 Scoring.jpg`, `BS2 Scoring.jpg`, and `BP5_BP2 Scoring.jpg`. No change to the underlying ClinGen specification version.**

- **PS2/PM6 source mismatch exposed:** image-only PS2 Supporting and PM6 Very Strong tiers are distinguished from the main-PDF tiers, and bare totals have comparator marked unstated.
- **PS4 comparator restored:** the main PDF's inclusive `>=1 / >=3 / >=5` thresholds are preserved separately from the image's exact 1.0/3.0/5.0 footer.
- **BS2 contradiction exposed:** the main PDF's -4-point Strong tier and image's -3-point Strong tier are both retained and flagged rather than silently selecting the image.
- **BP2/BP5 contradiction exposed:** main-PDF `>=(-4) / >=(-2) / >=(-1)` tiers conflict with image `-3 / N/A / -1`; both and the anomalous comparator direction are documented without resolution.
- **Functional assays retranscribed:** restored the exact DOIs, years, replicate/control/statistical fields, approvals, and workbook readout wording. The previous MEK abnormal threshold (“increased pMEK/MEK ratio compared with controls”) was removed because it is absent from the workbook. The P-labelled entries in B/LB fields, VUS entries in P/LP fields, missing benign controls, and approvals despite unmet validation fields are now explicitly reported.
- **PM1/analogy provenance tightened:** removed four unsourced domain-function descriptions; recorded that `Analogous Residues.pdf` is an image alignment rather than a discrete exhaustive residue map.
- **Missing BP1 support documented:** none of the distributed supplements contains the dosage-sensitivity/LoF-disorder information referenced by the main PDF.
- **Source wording preserved:** restored the PM5 “residues changes” typo, flagged the PS4 “≥1 points” typo, retained the BP4 summary/strength-row difference, and recorded the PS3/BP2/BP5 combining-rule tensions.
- **Fabricated provenance removed:** replaced the prior full bibliography for bare PMID 29543229 with the source's actual PMID-level citation.
