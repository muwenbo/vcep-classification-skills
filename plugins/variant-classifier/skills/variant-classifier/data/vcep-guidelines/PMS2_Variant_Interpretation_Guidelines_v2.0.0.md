## 2. Pathogenic Criteria

### PVS1 - Null Variant

**Original ACMG Summary:** Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical +/−1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease.

**Caveats (original ACMG):**
- Beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g. GFAP, MYH7).
- Use caution interpreting LOF variants at the extreme 3' end of a gene.
- Use caution with splice variants that are predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the protein intact.
- Use caution in the presence of multiple transcripts.

#### Very Strong (PVS1)

*Modification type: General recommendation*

Nonsense/frameshift variant introducing Premature Termination Codon (PTC)ᵃ **≤ codon 798** in *PMS2*. Refer to Appendix for details.

OR

Large genomic alterationsᵃ of single or multi-exon size.

OR

Variants at IVS±1 or IVS±2\*\*ᵃ,ᶜ \*\* where exon skipping or use of a cryptic splice site disrupts reading frame and is predicted to undergo NMD. Not to be combined with PP3 and not to be used for a confirmed splice defect (see PVS1 for variants where patient mRNA assays indicate splicing aberration). If exon skipping or use of a cryptic splice site preserves reading frame and the altered region is critical to protein functionᵇ then use PVS1_Strong. If exon skipping or use of a cryptic splice site disrupts reading frame and is NOT predicted to undergo NMD then use PVS1_Moderate.

OR

Variants where mRNA assays using RNA derived from patient constitutional biological samples indicate that the variant allele results in a splicing aberration (with evidence that the variant allele produces no full-length/reference transcript) leading to premature stop codon or in-frame deletion disrupting a functional domainᵇ or protein conformation. Splicing aberration must be confirmed in a minigene assay or an additional RNA assay from an independent laboratory if it is a non-canonical splice site variant.

#### Strong (PVS1_Strong)

*Modification type: General recommendation*

Variants in the initiation codon of *PMS2*.

OR

Presumed by default in tandem duplication of ≥1 exon resulting in a frameshift before the last splice junction. This rule does not apply for variants that involve the UTR (i.e. exon 1 or last exon) and whole gene duplications.

OR

G>non-G at last base of exon if first 6 bases of the intron are not GTRRGT. If confirmed to cause a splice defect, then PVS1 should be used instead.

OR

Variants at IVS±1 or IVS±2ᵃ,ᶜ where exon skipping or use of a cryptic splice site preserves reading frame and the altered region is critical to protein functionᵇ. Not to be combined with PP3 and not to be used for a confirmed splice defect (see PVS1 for variants where patient mRNA assays indicate splicing aberration).

#### Moderate (PVS1_Moderate)

*Modification type: Gene-specific*

Nonsense/frameshift variant introducing premature termination codon between **codons 799 & 862** in *PMS2*. Refer to Appendix for details.

#### Supporting (PVS1_Supporting)

Not specified by VCEP.

---

### PS1 - Same Amino Acid Change

**Original ACMG Summary:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change. Example: Val->Leu caused by either G>C or G>T in the same codon. Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:** SpliceAI masked score option should be checked on.

#### Strong (PS1)

*Modification type: General recommendation*

A predicted missense substitution that encodes the same amino acid change with a different underlying nucleotide change previously established by this VCEP as **Pathogenic** (not a predicted or confirmed splice defect).

OR

Variants affecting the same non-canonical splice nucleotide as a **confirmed Pathogenic** splice variant with similar or worse splicing in silico prediction using SpliceAI.

#### Moderate (PS1_Moderate)

*Modification type: General recommendation*

A predicted missense substitution that encodes the same amino acid change with a different underlying nucleotide change as a previously established **Likely Pathogenic** missense variant with normal RNA result\*, and PM2_supporting is met.

\*Otherwise, if the previously established Likely pathogenic missense variant truly is a splice defect, the new missense variant also has to be investigated on a functional level for RNA splicing.

OR

Variants affecting the same non-canonical splice nucleotide as a **Likely Pathogenic** splice variant with similar or worse splicing in silico prediction using SpliceAI.

---

### PS2 - De Novo (Confirmed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history. Note: Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, etc. can contribute to non-maternity.

#### VCEP Specifications — Points per Proband

| Observation | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| Proband with a *de novo* variant with both maternity and paternity confirmed in a case with MMR deficient LS spectrum tumor\* (i.e. MSI/IHC consistent with affected gene, with no MLH1 methylation in tumor tissue, with the exception of MLH1 constitutional promoter methylation). Refer to Appendix for protein expression consistent with variant location. | **2 points per proband** |
| Proband with a *de novo* variant with both maternity and paternity confirmed in a case with LS spectrum tumor\* (with no tumor data for MSI/IHC/methylation). | **1 point per proband** |
| Proband with assumed *de novo* variant and maternity and/or paternity unconfirmed with LS spectrum tumor\* (No tumor data for MSI/IHC/methylation). | **0.5 points per proband** |

\*Lynch Syndrome (LS) tumors include: colorectal/colon/rectal, endometrial, ovarian, small bowel/small intestine, renal pelvis, ureter, and stomach/gastric carcinomas, sebaceous skin tumors (adenomas and carcinomas), gliomas.

#### Evidence Strength Thresholds

*Modification type: Disease-specific*

| Total *de novo* Points | Evidence Strength |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| ≥ 4 points | **PS2_VeryStrong** |
| 2 - 3.5 points | **PS2 (Strong)** |
| 1 - 1.5 points | **PS2_Moderate** |
| 0.5 points | **PS2_Supporting** |

---

### PS3 - Functional Studies

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product. Note: Functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well-established.

**VCEP Specifications:** Refer to file 'Functional assay SVI documentation (MMR genes)' for calibrated functional assays.

\*The functional assay flowchart is a general framework for evaluating functional assays that were already performed, or from historic publications, not for prospective studies on variants. The information describing these assays are generic. The VCEP recommends use of the calibrated assays for prospective testing.

#### Strength Levels

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong (PS3)** | Calibrated functional assays with functional odds for Pathogenicity **> 18.7** |
| **Moderate (PS3_Moderate)** | Calibrated functional assays with functional odds for pathogenicity **>4.3 and <= 18.7**<br>OR<br>MMR function defect following functional assay flowchart\*<br>OR<br>Variants with monoallelic expression: complete loss of expression (<10% of wild-type in cDNA without puromycin) of the variant allele. Full-length transcript should be analysed with and without NMD block. |
| **Supporting (PS3_Supporting)** | Calibrated functional odds for pathogenicity **>2.08 and <= 4.3** |

*Modification type (all levels): General recommendation*

---

### PS4 - Prevalence in Affected

**Original ACMG Summary:** The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls.

**Status: NOT APPLICABLE**

**Comment:** Due to the availability of tumor IHC data for variant classification (see PP4), PS4 has not been utilized for MMR variant classification using proband counting.

---

### PM1 - Mutational Hot Spot

**Original ACMG Summary:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation.

**Status: NOT APPLICABLE**

**Comment:** There are no recognized mutational hot spots that could be used for classification purposes. While there are functional domains in the MMR genes, the distribution of pathogenic variants is generalized over all the domains (unpublished data).

---

### PM2 - Absent from Controls

**Original ACMG Summary:** Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium. Caveat: Population data for indels may be poorly called by next generation sequencing.

#### VCEP Specification

*Modification type: General recommendation*

| Strength | Threshold |
|----------|-----------|
| **PM2_Supporting** | Absent/extremely rare allele frequency **<0.00002** (<1 in 50,000 alleles) in **gnomAD v4** dataset |

---

### PM3 - In Trans with Pathogenic Variant

**Original ACMG Summary:** For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant. Note: This requires testing of parents (or offspring) to determine phase.

#### VCEP Specifications

Co-occurrence with a known pathogenic/likely pathogenic sequence variant in the same gene in a patient with clinical features consistent with CMMRD as per Aronson et al 2022 - Refer to "Table for CMMRD diagnosis.pdf". **For MLH1 variants - the variant has to meet PM2_Supporting criteria.**

*(Note: the "For MLH1 variants" sentence appears verbatim in this PMS2 specification document; it is reproduced here as written in the source.)*

##### Points by Classification/Zygosity of Other Variant

| Classification/Zygosity of Other Variant | Points |
|------------------------------------------|--------|
| Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic *in trans* | 1.0 point |
| Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic - phase unknown | 0.5 points |

Sum all cases with the above evidence to determine the PM3 strength.

##### Evidence Strength Thresholds

*Modification type: Disease-specific*

| Total Points | Evidence Strength |
|--------------|-------------------|
| ≥ 4 points | **PM3_VeryStrong** |
| 2 - 3.5 points | **PM3_Strong** |
| 1 - 1.5 points | **PM3 (Moderate)** |
| = 0.5 points | **PM3_Supporting** |

---

### PM4 - Protein Length Changes

**Original ACMG Summary:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

**Status: NOT APPLICABLE**

**Comment:** Protein length change from an in-frame variant is not used due to lack of evidence.

---

### PM5 - Novel Missense at Same Residue

**Original ACMG Summary:** Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before. Example: Arg156His is pathogenic; now you observe Arg156Cys. Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

#### Moderate (PM5)

*Modification type: General recommendation*

Missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change was classified by this VCEP as **Pathogenic** on the protein level and not due to aberrant splicing. Only use PM5 if PP3 is supporting for the missense change. Use PM5_Supporting if other variant is Likely Pathogenic due to a missense alteration.

#### Supporting (PM5_Supporting)

*Modification type: General recommendation*

Missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change was classified as **Likely Pathogenic** on the protein level and not due to aberrant splicing. Only use PM5_Supporting if PP3 is supporting for the missense change. Use PM5 if other variant is Pathogenic due to a missense alteration.

---

### PM6 - De Novo (Assumed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity.

**Status: NOT APPLICABLE (as a separate criterion)**

**Comment:** Please see PS2.

---

### PP1 - Co-segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease. Note: May be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data.

#### VCEP Specifications

\*For multiple pedigrees, results are combined by multiplying together.

Recommended segregation analysis tool: COOL (COsegregation OnLine) v3 — https://fenglab.chpc.utah.edu/cool3/manual.html

Copy the example pedigree format and complete the fields to build the pedigree in text format. Refer to online manual for cancer types to enter into pedigree. Click on the 'Analysis' tab to view the webform for pedigree file upload and enter appropriate parameters for population and allele frequency. Penetrance file and relative risk file are not required for MMR genes. Use the 'overall Bayes Factor' to determine evidence strength.

#### Strength Thresholds

*Modification type (all levels): General recommendation*

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong (PP1_Strong)** | Co-segregation with disease in pedigree(s) with a combined\* Bayes Likelihood Ratioᶠ **>18.7 in ≥2 families** |
| **Moderate (PP1_Moderate)** | Co-segregation with disease in pedigree(s) with a combined\* Bayes Likelihood Ratioᶠ **>4.3 & ≤18.7** |
| **Supporting (PP1)** | Co-segregation with disease in pedigree(s) with a combined\* Bayes Likelihood Ratioᶠ **>2.08 & ≤4.3** |

---

### PP2 - Missense in Constrained Gene

**Original ACMG Summary:** Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.

**Status: NOT APPLICABLE**

**Comment:** Missense variant in a gene with low rate of benign missense changes does not apply.

---

### PP3 - Computational Evidence

**Original ACMG Summary:** Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact). Caveat: As many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion. PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.

**VCEP Specifications:** SpliceAI masked score option should be checked on. For HCI-PRIORS, ensure correct gene is selected from the tabs, and enter the nucleotide number in either HGVS position or HG38 genomic co-ordinate and click 'view'. The output shows 3 substitutions at the nucleotide location, with probability based on splicing and protein predictions. Ensure the 'applicable prior' is used that corresponds to the variant under review.

#### Moderate (PP3_Moderate)

*Modification type: General recommendation*

Missense variant with "MAPP/PP2 Prior P" score **>0.81** from http://hci-lovd.hci.utah.edu/variants.php?select_db=PMS2_priors&action=search_unique

#### Supporting (PP3)

*Modification type: General recommendation*

Missense variant with "MAPP/PP2 Prior P" score **>0.68 & ≤0.81** from http://hci-lovd.hci.utah.edu/variants.php?select_db=PMS2_priors&action=search_unique

OR

Predicted splice defect for non-canonical splicing nucleotides using SpliceAI with **delta score >= 0.2** as per Walker et al 2023.

---

### PP4 - Phenotype Specificity

**Original ACMG Summary:** Patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

#### VCEP Specifications

ᵉStandard MSI markers panel: BAT25, BAT26, BAT40, BAT34, D5S346, D17S250, ACTC, D18S55, D10S197, MYCL; D2S123, D18S69; NR21, NR24, NR27

**Protein Expression and consistency with variant location:** IHC evidence should be consistent with the variant gene and the protein that is tested and take into account the MutSα and MutLα heterodimers: MLH1 and PMS2 loss is consistent with an MLH1 pathogenic variant, MSH2 and MSH6 loss is consistent with an MSH2 pathogenic variant, MSH6 loss is consistent with an MSH6 pathogenic variant, and PMS2 loss is consistent with a PMS2 pathogenic variant.

#### Strength Levels

*Modification type (all levels): Disease-specific*

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong (PP4_Strong)** | **≥3** independent CRC/Endometrial MSI-H tumors in **≥2 families** using a standard panel of 5-10 markersᵉ or tumor genome **and/or** loss of MMR protein expression consistent with the variant location. MSI-H tumor with inconsistent protein expression does not meet PP4_Strong. Independent tumors can be from the same patient/family. |
| **Moderate (PP4_Moderate)** | **2** independent CRC/Endometrial MSI-H tumors using a standard panel of 5-10 markersᵉ or tumor genome **and/or** loss of MMR protein expression consistent with the variant location. MSI-H tumor with inconsistent protein expression does not meet PP4_Moderate. |
| **Supporting (PP4)** | **1** CRC/Endometrial MSI-H tumor using a standard panel of 5-10 markersᵉ or tumor genome **and/or** loss of MMR protein expression consistent with the variant location. MSI-H tumor with inconsistent protein expression does not meet PP4. |

---

### PP5 - Reputable Source

**Original ACMG Summary:** Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation.

**Status: NOT APPLICABLE**

**Comment:** This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee (PMID: 29543229).

---

## 3. Benign Criteria

### BA1 - Stand-Alone Benign

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is above 5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

#### VCEP Specification

*Modification type: Gene-specific*

| Strength | Threshold |
|----------|-----------|
| **BA1 (Stand Alone)** | GnomAD v4 Grpmax filtering allele frequency **≥ 0.0028 (0.28%)** and variant is excluded as founder pathogenic variant |

---

### BS1 - Allele Frequency Greater Than Expected

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.

#### VCEP Specification

*Modification type: Gene-specific*

| Strength | Threshold |
|----------|-----------|
| **BS1 (Strong)** | GnomAD v4 Grpmax filtering allele frequency **≥ 0.00028 and < 0.0028 (0.028-0.28%)** and variant is excluded as founder pathogenic variant |

---

### BS2 - Observed in Healthy Adult

**Original ACMG Summary:** Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.

#### VCEP Specification

*Modification type: Disease-specific*

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **BS2 (Strong)** | Co-occurrence *in trans* with a known pathogenic sequence variant in the same gene in a patient with colorectal cancer after age 45 (or other LS cancer above the median age of onset for that cancer in LSᵈ), and who has no previous or current evidence of clinical manifestations of CMMRD as per Aronson et al 2022 (Refer to 'Table for CMMRD diagnosis.pdf'). Confirmation of phase requires testing of parents or offspring. |

---

### BS3 - Functional Studies (Benign)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.

**VCEP Specifications:** Refer to file 'Functional assay SVI documentation (MMR genes)' for calibrated functional assays.

\*The functional assay flowchart is a general framework for evaluating functional assays that were already performed, or from historic publications, not for prospective studies on variants. The information describing these assays are generic. The VCEP recommends use of the calibrated assays for prospective testing.

#### Strength Levels

*Modification type (all levels): General recommendation*

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong (BS3)** | Calibrated functional assays with functional odds for Pathogenicity **≤ 0.05**<br>OR<br>Synonymous substitutions and intronic variants with no associated mRNA aberration (either splicing or allelic imbalance) as determined by laboratory assays conducted with nonsense-mediated decay inhibition. Whenever abnormal transcripts are identified at similar levels in controls they will be considered naturally occurring isoforms and not mRNA aberrations. |
| **Supporting (BS3_Supporting)** | Calibrated functional assays with functional odds for Pathogenicity **>0.05 & ≤0.48**<br>OR<br>Variant-specific proficient function in protein and mRNA-based lab assays as per MMR functional assay flowchart. |

---

### BS4 - Lack of Segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family. Caveat: The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e. cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.

#### VCEP Specifications

\*For multiple pedigrees, results are combined by multiplying together.

Recommended segregation analysis tool: COOL (COsegregation OnLine) v3 — https://fenglab.chpc.utah.edu/cool3/manual.html

Copy the example pedigree format and complete the fields to build the pedigree in text format. Refer to online manual for cancer types to enter into pedigree. Click on the 'Analysis' tab to view the webform for pedigree file upload and enter appropriate parameters for population and allele frequency. Penetrance file and relative risk file are not required for MMR genes. Use the 'overall Bayes Factor' to determine evidence strength.

#### Strength Levels

*Modification type (all levels): General recommendation*

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong (BS4)** | Lack of co-segregation with disease in pedigree(s) with a combined\* Bayes Likelihood Ratioᶠ **<0.05**.<br>\*For multiple pedigrees, results are combined. Recommended segregation analysis tool: COOL (COsegregation OnLine) v2 — http://fengbj-laboratory.org/cool2/manual.html |
| **Supporting (BS4_Supporting)** | Lack of co-segregation with disease in pedigree(s) with a combined\* Bayes Likelihood Ratioᶠ **>0.05 & ≤0.48**.<br>\*with multiple pedigrees, results are combined. Recommended segregation analysis tool: COOL (COsegregation OnLine) v2 — http://fengbj-laboratory.org/cool2/manual.html |

> **Source inconsistency flagged:** the BS4 header text recommends **COOL v3** (https://fenglab.chpc.utah.edu/cool3/manual.html) while the BS4 Strong and Supporting rows each recommend **COOL v2** (http://fengbj-laboratory.org/cool2/manual.html). Both are reproduced verbatim from the specification.

BP4 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.

**VCEP Specifications:** SpliceAI masked score option should be checked on. For HCI-PRIORS, ensure correct gene is selected from the tabs, and enter the nucleotide number in either HGVS position or HG38 genomic co-ordinate and click 'view'. The output shows 3 substitutions at the nucleotide location, with probability based on splicing and protein predictions. Ensure the 'applicable prior' is used that corresponds to the variant under review.

*Modification type: General recommendation*

> **Source note:** BP5_Strong says "BRAF V600E (**CRC** only)" while BP5_Supporting says "BRAF V600E (**Colon** only)". Reproduced verbatim.

#### BP7 - Synonymous/Intronic Variants

**Original ACMG Summary:** A synonymous variant for which splicing prediction algorithms predict no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved.

*Modification type: General recommendation*

**Supporting (BP7):**
A synonymous (silent) or intronic variant at or beyond -21/+7 (5'/3' exonic). Variants may satisfy both BP7 and BP4.

| **PP5** | Reputable source reports pathogenic | Not for use as recommended by the ClinGen SVI VCEP Review Committee (PMID: 29543229). |
| **BP1** | Missense in truncating disease gene | Missense variant in a gene where only loss of function causes disease is not applicable. |

| **a** | PVS1 criteria is adapted from Tayoun et al. 2018. |
| **b** | A known functional protein domain is reported to harbor sequence variants that introduce deleterious changes to protein function (via missense alteration, protein sequence deletion, or protein truncation in the last exon) AND are associated with high risk of cancer. Physical boundaries for functional domains are shown in MMR functional domains pdf. |
| **c** | IVS±1 and IVS±2 are the least invariant nucleotides in a splice site |
| **d** | Lynch Syndrome (LS) tumors include: colorectal/colon/rectal, endometrial, ovarian, small bowel/small intestine, renal pelvis, ureter, and stomach/gastric carcinomas, sebaceous skin tumors (adenomas and carcinomas), gliomas. |
| **e** | Standard MSI markers panel: BAT25, BAT26, BAT40, BAT34, D5S346, D17S250, ACTC, D18S55, D10S197, MYCL; D2S123, D18S69; NR21, NR24, NR27 |
| **f** | Likelihood ratios for segregation can be derived by Bayes factor analysis adapted from the method of Thompson et al. 2003. Penetrance estimates for MLH1 and MSH2 are from Jenkins et al. 2015 and Dowty et al. 2013; MSH6 from Baglietto et al. 2010; PMS2 from ten Broeke et al. 2015 |

### Appendix B: PVS1 Decision Tree (MMR genes) — PMS2 branches

**Nonsense or Frameshift**

| Condition | PVS1 Strength |
|-----------|---------------|
| Predicted to undergo NMD: ≤ codon 798 in PMS2 | **PVS1** |
| Not predicted to undergo NMD + truncated/altered region critical to protein function: ≤ codon 798 in PMS2 | **PVS1** |
| Not predicted to undergo NMD + role of region in protein function is unknown: between codons 799 & 862 in PMS2 | **PVS1_Moderate** |

**GT-AG ±1,2 splice sitesᵃ**

| Condition | PVS1 Strength |
|-----------|---------------|
| Exon skipping or use of a cryptic splice site disrupts reading frame and is predicted to undergo NMD | **PVS1** |
| Exon skipping or use of a cryptic splice site disrupts reading frame and is NOT predicted to undergo NMD | **PVS1_Moderate** |
| Exon skipping or use of a cryptic splice site preserves reading frame | **PVS1_Strong** |

**Deletion (single exon to full gene):** **PVS1**ᵃ

**Duplication (≥1 exon in size and must be completely contained within gene)**

| Condition | PVS1 Strength |
|-----------|---------------|
| Proven in tandem: large genomic duplications shown by laboratory studies (which define the breakpoints of the duplication) to result in a frameshift before the last splice junction (NMD predicted to occur) **OR** to result in an in-frame insertion disrupting a functional domainᵇ or protein conformation | **PVS1** |
| Presumed in tandem: presumed by default in tandem duplication of ≥1 exon resulting in a frameshift before the last splice junction. Does not apply for variants that involve the UTR (i.e. exon 1 or last exon) and whole gene duplications | **PVS1_Strong** |

**Initiation Codon**

| Condition | PVS1 Strength |
|-----------|---------------|
| No known alternative start codon in other transcripts: variants in the initiation codon of MSH6 or **PMS2** | **PVS1_Strong** |

### Appendix C: Exon Deletions/Duplications — In-frame / Out-of-frame (PMS2)

Source: https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/scripts/readingFrameChecker.php

| Exon | PMS2 |
|------|------|
| Exon 1 | N/A\* |
| Exon 2 | Out-of-frame |
| Exon 3 | In-frame |
| Exon 4 | Out-of-frame |
| Exon 5 | Out-of-frame |
| Exon 6 | In-frame |
| Exon 7 | Out-of-frame |
| Exon 8 | Out-of-frame |
| Exon 9 | Out-of-frame |
| Exon 10 | In-frame |
| Exon 11 | Out-of-frame |
| Exon 12 | In-frame |
| Exon 13 | Out-of-frame |
| Exon 14 | Out-of-frame |
| Exon 15 | N/A\* |

\*First and last exon deletions/duplications are difficult to predict whether in-frame or out-of-frame.

**Justification for last exon PVS1 boundaries (PMS2):** Nonsense/frameshift variant introducing Premature Termination Codon (PTC) ≤ codon 798 in PMS2 using ≥50 nucleotide NMD-rule.

### Appendix D: Derivation of Probability Values from Odds

| Probability | Odds | Evidence level |
|-------------|------|----------------|
| 0.11 | 0.48 | Benign Supporting level of benign evidence using 0.2 prior – consistent with ACMG Bayesian model |
| 0.68 | 2.08 | Pathogenic Supporting level of evidence using 0.5 prior – consistent with ACMG Bayesian model |
| 0.81 | 4.3 | Pathogenic Supporting level of evidence using 0.5 prior – consistent with ACMG Bayesian model |

### Appendix E: PMS2 Functional Domains

### Appendix H: MMR Functional Assay Flowchart (summary)

The flowchart ("MMR Functional assay flowchart.pdf") triages an MMR gene sequence variant by type:

- **In-frame indel or missense variant** → if first/last 3 bases of the exon or splicing impact predicted → route to splicing assay; otherwise → was a calibrated functional assay conducted?
  - **Yes** → Quantitative multifactorial analysis OR convert functional LR to ACMG/AMP evidence weight.
  - **No** → require **2 independent assays with concordant results**: mammalian MMR activity assays (similar repair levels to deficient cell line/pathogenic controls → *deficient function*; similar to wild-type/pathogenic controls → assessment of protein expression/stability). Protein expression ≤25% relative expression or similar to deficient cell line control → *deficient function*; ≥75% relative expression or similar to wild-type control → subcellular localization and cellular-based MMR activity assays (cytoplasmic, tolerant to DNA damage or high mutator phenotype → *deficient function*; nuclear, sensitive to DNA damage and no mutator phenotype → *proficient function*). Inconclusive results → further research calibrating against clinical data.
- **Splice site, silent, or intronic** → splicing assay. Complete impact → *deficient function*. Partial/unknown impact → treat as in-frame/missense branch. No impact → if in-frame or missense variant, route to missense branch; otherwise, were NMD-inhibitors included? Yes → further research calibrating against clinical data; No → patient-derived RNA assays? Yes → *deficient/proficient function* determination.

> **Note on the "2 Strong" release note:** the release notes state that "2 Strong" was changed from Pathogenic to Likely Pathogenic, but the published Rules for Combining Criteria table in this same v2.0 document still lists "≥ 2 Strong" under **Pathogenic** (and does not list it under Likely Pathogenic). Both are reproduced above exactly as they appear in the specification; users should be aware of this discrepancy.
