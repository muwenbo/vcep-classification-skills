## Pathogenic Criteria

### PVS1 - Null Variant

**Original ACMG Summary:** Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical ±1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease.

**Caveats:**
- Beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g. GFAP, MYH7)
- Use caution interpreting LOF variants at the extreme 3' end of a gene
- Use caution with splice variants that are predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the protein intact
- Use caution in the presence of multiple transcripts

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

**Comments:** Not applicable. The disease mechanism for MAP2K1-associated RASopathy is gain-of-function, not loss-of-function.

---

### PS1 - Same Amino Acid Change

**Original ACMG Summary:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.

**Example:** Val->Leu caused by either G>C or G>T in the same codon.

**Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:** Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong (PS1)** | Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change. Applicable for observed analogous residue positions in *MAP2K1* and *MAP2K2*. |

**Modification Type:** Analogous Gene

**Note:** Analogous residues between MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 can be used to support this criterion. See Appendix A for analogous residue mapping.

---

### PS2 - De Novo (Confirmed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history.

**Note:** Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, etc. can contribute to non-maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** Follow SVI recommendations for point-based scoring in conjunction with PM6 (see Reference 1) and phenotypic specifications: full points awarded with RASopathy phenotypes, reduced points applicable to cases with minimal phenotypic information (i.e. prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests such as WES).

#### PS2/PM6 Point System (Per Proband)

| Phenotypic Consistency | Confirmed *de novo* (PS2) | Assumed *de novo* (PM6) |
|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Phenotype is consistent with a RASopathy* | 2 | 1 |
| Limited phenotypic information** | 1 | 0.5 |
| Phenotype not consistent with RASopathy | 0 | 0 |

*\*Exclusive of prenatal cases*

*\*\*Applicable to prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES). Phenotypes for prenatal cases include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, increased nuchal translucency, cystic hygroma, or hydrops.*

#### Evidence Strength Thresholds

| Points | Strength Level |
|--------|----------------|
| 0.5 | Supporting (PS2_Supporting or PM6_Supporting) |
| 1.0 | Moderate (PS2_Moderate or PM6) |
| 2.0 | Strong (PS2 or PM6_Strong) |
| 4.0 | Very Strong (PS2_VeryStrong or PM6_VeryStrong) |

**Modification Type:** Strength

> **Source discrepancy (unresolved):** `PS2_PM6 Scoring.jpg` names PS2_Supporting and PM6_VeryStrong, but `ClinGen_ACMG_Specifications_MAP2K1_v2.3.pdf` does not define either strength. The PDF defines PS2 at Moderate, Strong, and Very Strong and PM6 at Supporting, Moderate, and Strong. Both sources print exact point values without threshold comparators. The image-only strength names are reported without extending the PDF criteria.

---

### PS3 - Functional Studies

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product.

**Note:** Functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well-established.

**VCEP Specifications:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product. Approved assays are available in the supplemental materials.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate (PS3_Moderate)** | Two or more different approved assays |
| **Supporting (PS3_Supporting)** | One approved assay |

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific, Gene-specific, Strength

#### Approved Functional Assays for MAP2K1

The following assays have been approved for use with MAP2K1 variants:

| Assay | Description | Specificity | Applicable to MAP2K1 |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **MEK Activation Assay** | Measures the ratio of phosphorylated MEK to unphosphorylated MEK, basally and following RTK stimulation | Pathway Specific | PS3_Supporting; BS3_NA |
| **ERK Activation Assay** | Measures the ratio of phosphorylated ERK to unphosphorylated ERK, basally and following stimulation | Pathway Specific | PS3_Supporting; BS3_NA |
| **RAS Activation Assay** | Measures the bound RAS protein that immunoprecipitated with RAF1 or RBD (synthetic) | Pathway Specific (upstream genes only) | No* |

*\*RAS activation assay is pathway-specific for genes upstream from RAS and RAS proteins themselves but not for downstream components like MAP2K1.*

**Important Notes:**
- All assays are expected to be validated by the performing laboratory in accordance with standard procedures with all appropriate control inclusions (PMID: 31892348)
- Abnormal results should be compared relative to the known status of the controls included in the assay
- Multiple assays are pathway-specific meaning they evaluate the effect of a variant on the Ras/MAPK pathway; controls from any gene may be used to support abnormal pathway function
- Assays not listed are presumed to lack sufficient historical evidence and may only be sufficient for PS3_Supporting or BS3_Supporting; however, both approved MAP2K1 assay columns explicitly state BS3_NA
- Animal models and variant-specific assays have been excluded as the assays herein are considered most appropriate

#### MAP2K1 Assay Validation Details

**MEK Activation Assay**

- Sources: Nelson (2015), Chen (2020), and Smits (2020); PMIDs 25899310, 31972311, and 32703450; DOI 10.1002/gcc.22247, 10.1016/j.gene.2020.144369, and 10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.06.022.
- Material/readout: HEK293T cells transfected with 0.5 mg DDK-tagged MAP2K1 or MAP3K1 cDNAs or empty vector using FuGENE HD; SH-SY5Y cells separately transfected with WT or variant; and HUVEC lentiviral cell lines generated in ECFCs isolated from human white adipose tissue. The semi-quantitative/qualitative readout is the pMEK/MEK ratio basally and/or after RTK stimulation.
- Replication and controls: biological replicates not met; technical replicates met (`3 independent experiment/experiment repeated 3 times`); WT/HWAT ECFC/HUVEC WT positive controls and vector/empty-lentivirus negative controls met.
- P/LP validation controls: `4 (F57C, P128Q, Y130C - NA, (S222D);(S226D) trans)`; no B/LB controls.
- Statistics: one-way ANOVA/Mann-Whitney U test.
- Normal readout: normal WT pattern. Abnormal readout: constitutively active, increased phosphorylation protein, and/or prolonged phosphorylation.

**ERK Activation Assay**

- Sources: Nelson (2015), Chen (2020), and Smits (2020); PMIDs 25899310, 31972311, and 32703450; DOI 10.1002/gcc.22247, 10.1016/j.gene.2020.144369, and 10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.06.022.
- Material/readout: HEK293T cells transfected with 0.5 mg DDK-tagged MAP2K1 or MAP3K1 cDNAs or empty vector using FuGENE HD; SH-SY5Y cells transfected with WT/mutants using Lipofectamine 2000; and HUVEC WT/K57N lentiviral lines generated in ECFCs isolated from human white adipose tissue. The semi-quantitative/qualitative readout is the pERK/ERK ratio basally and after stimulation.
- Replication and controls: biological replicates not met; technical replicates met (`3 independent/repeated experiments`); WT/HWAT ECFC positive controls and vector negative control met.
- P/LP validation controls: `8 (56_61QKQKVG>R - NA, K57M - P, K57N - P/LP, C121S - P/LP, G128D - LP, G128V - P/LP, (C121S);(G128D) trans, Y130C - P)`; no B/LB controls.
- Statistics: one-way ANOVA/Mann-Whitney U test.
- Normal readout: normal WT pattern. Abnormal readout: constitutively active, increased phosphorylation protein, and/or prolonged phosphorylation.

> **Source control notes:** `Approved Functional Studies.xlsx` places Y130C labelled `NA` in the MEK P/LP validation-control row and `56_61QKQKVG>R` labelled `NA` in the ERK P/LP row. These internal workbook inconsistencies are reported without reassigning the controls.

> **Workbook scope note:** MAP2K1 has no RAS Activation Assay column. The hidden AKT sheet is explicitly unapproved and contains NRAS only; the hidden cell-survival sheet is dummy example data (PMID 1234567, Jones, 1985); and the hidden animal-model and myristoylation material is excluded by the workbook's own policy.

### PS4 - Prevalence in Affected

**Original ACMG Summary:** The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls.

**Note 1:** Relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR), as obtained from case-control studies, is >5.0 and the confidence interval around the estimate of RR or OR does not include 1.0.

**Note 2:** In instances of very rare variants where case-control studies may not reach statistical significance, the prior observation of the variant in multiple unrelated patients with the same phenotype, and its absence in controls, may be used as moderate level of evidence.

**VCEP Specifications:** Strength adjustment using point-based scoring for autosomal dominant cases with phenotypic specifications: full points awarded with RASopathy phenotypes, reduced points applicable to cases with minimal phenotypic information.

#### PS4 Point System (Per Proband)

| Phenotypic Consistency | Points per Proband |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Individual well-phenotyped with features of a RASopathy | 1 |
| Limited phenotypic information compatible with RASopathy* | 0.5 |
| No clinical information or isolated clinical features | 0 |
| Well-phenotyped but consistent with non-RASopathy disorder** | -1 |

*\*Applicable to prenatal cases, cases with a clinical order of a RASopathy panel without clinical information, and cases with limited clinical information in other global tests (such as WES). Phenotypes for prenatal cases include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, increased nuchal translucency, cystic hygroma, or hydrops.*

*\*\*Negative points for PS4 represent proband affected with a non-RASopathy congenital disorder rather than a healthy individual (BS2). This typically applies to probands tested by exome analysis with multiple other clinical features supporting a distinct syndromic disorder (e.g. CHARGE, CdLS).*

#### Evidence Strength Thresholds

| Total Points | Strength Level |
|--------------|----------------|
| ≥1.0 | Supporting (PS4_Supporting) |
| ≥3.0 | Moderate (PS4_Moderate) |
| ≥5.0 | Strong (PS4) |

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

> **Comparator note:** The inclusive `≥` thresholds above come from `ClinGen_ACMG_Specifications_MAP2K1_v2.3.pdf`. `PS4 Scoring.jpg` prints exact 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 values without comparators. The attachment's omission is reported rather than treated as a different operator.

---

### PM1 - Mutational Hot Spot

**Original ACMG Summary:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation.

**VCEP Specifications:** Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain without benign variation. PM1 and PM5 may be used in conjunction at moderate levels, however, PM1 may not be applied if PM5_Strong is applied to avoid overweighting.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate (PM1)** | Applicable only to critical and well-established functional domains available in the supplementary table (AA 43-61, AA 124-134). Not applicable to specific amino acid residues (see PM5). |

**Modification Type:** Gene-specific

#### MAP2K1 Critical Functional Domains

> **⚠️ NOT IN DISTRIBUTED PACKAGE — could not be source-verified.**
>
> The distributed specification defines only the ranges AA 43–61 and AA 124–134; neither it nor `Analogous Residues.xlsx` names these ranges. The prior descriptive labels are retained below as unverified operational context.

| Domain | Amino Acid Range |
|--------|------------------|
| Negative regulatory region | AA 43-61 |
| Catalytic core region | AA 124-134 |

**Note:** PM1 should NOT be applied if PM5_Strong is applied to avoid overweighting.

---

### PM2 - Absent from Controls

**Original ACMG Summary:** Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

**Caveat:** Population data for indels may be poorly called by next generation sequencing.

**VCEP Specifications:** The variant must be absent from controls (gnomAD).

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Supporting (PM2_Supporting)** | The variant must be absent from controls (gnomAD) |

**Modification Type:** Strength

---

### PM3 - In Trans with Pathogenic

**Original ACMG Summary:** For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant.

**Note:** This requires testing of parents (or offspring) to determine phase.

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

**Comments:** Not applicable. MAP2K1-associated RASopathy follows autosomal dominant inheritance.

---

### PM4 - Protein Length Changes

**Original ACMG Summary:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

**VCEP Specifications:** Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Moderate (PM4)** | No known repetitive areas in gene. Use as described. |

**Modification Type:** General recommendation

---

### PM5 - Novel Missense at Same Residue

**Original ACMG Summary:** Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before.

**Example:** Arg156His is pathogenic; now you observe Arg156Cys.

**Caveat:** Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.

**VCEP Specifications:** Applicable for observed analogous residue positions in *MAP2K1* and *MAP2K2*. PM1 and PM5 may be used in conjunction at moderate levels, however, PM1 may not be applied if PM5_Strong is applied to avoid overweighting.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong (PM5_Strong)** | ≥2 different [likely] pathogenic residues changes at the same codon observed in ≥5 probands |
| **Moderate (PM5)** | 1 [likely] pathogenic residue change at the same codon |

**Modification Type:** Analogous Gene, Strength (for Strong); Analogous Gene, Disease-specific (for Moderate)

**Note:** PM1 may NOT be applied if PM5_Strong is applied to avoid overweighting.

> **Source wording note:** The source typo `residues changes` is preserved verbatim. The v2.3 release note removed `observed in ≥5 probands` only from PM5 at Moderate strength; the qualifier remains in the Strong row.

---

### PM6 - De Novo (Assumed)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity.

**VCEP Specifications:** Follow SVI recommendations for point-based scoring in conjunction with PS2 (see Reference 1) and phenotypic specifications: full points awarded with RASopathy phenotypes, reduced points applicable to cases with minimal phenotypic information.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong (PM6_Strong)** | 2 Points |
| **Moderate (PM6)** | 1 Point |
| **Supporting (PM6_Supporting)** | 0.5 Points |

**Modification Type:** Strength

*See PS2/PM6 Point System above for detailed scoring.*

---

### PP1 - Co-segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease.

**Note:** May be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data.

**VCEP Specifications:** Segregation in more than one family is recommended.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong (PP1_Strong)** | ≥7 informative meioses |
| **Moderate (PP1_Moderate)** | ≥5 informative meioses |
| **Supporting (PP1)** | ≥3 informative meioses |

**Modification Type:** Strength (Strong, Moderate); Disease-specific (Supporting)

---

### PP2 - Missense in Constrained Gene

**Original ACMG Summary:** Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.

**VCEP Specifications:** Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Supporting (PP2)** | Missense z score is >3.09 in gnomAD |

**Modification Type:** Gene-specific

---

### PP3 - Computational Evidence

**Original ACMG Summary:** Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.).

**Caveat:** As many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion. PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.

**VCEP Specifications:** For missense variants: REVEL ≥ 0.7. For splicing impact, predicted outcome must match disease mechanism.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Supporting (PP3)** | For missense variants: REVEL ≥ 0.7. For splicing impact, predicted outcome must match disease mechanism. |

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### PP4 - Phenotype Specificity

**Original ACMG Summary:** Patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

**Comments:** Not applicable, see PS4.

---

### PP5 - Reputable Source

**Original ACMG Summary:** Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation.

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee. (PMID: 29543229)

---

## Benign Criteria

### BA1 - Allele Frequency >5%

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is above 5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

**VCEP Specification:**

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Stand Alone (BA1)** | gnomAD filtering allele frequency ≥0.05% |

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### BS1 - Frequency Greater Than Expected

**Original ACMG Summary:** Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.

**VCEP Specification:**

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong (BS1)** | gnomAD filtering allele frequency ≥0.025% |

**Modification Type:** Disease-specific

---

### BS2 - Observed in Healthy Adult

**Original ACMG Summary:** Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.

**VCEP Specifications:** Strength adjustment using point-based scoring based on phenotypic specifications. Phenotypic specifications: based on healthy homozygote or heterozygote individuals, reduced points for apparently unaffected heterozygous individuals, applicable to parent or sibling samples during clinical family evaluations.

#### BS2 Point System (Per Individual)

| Phenotypic Consistency | Points per Individual |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Healthy homozygous individual assessed for a RASopathy | -3 |
| Healthy heterozygous individual assessed for a RASopathy | -1 |
| No phenotypic information other than "unaffected" heterozygote* | -0.25 |
| No clinical information or nonspecific clinical features | 0 |

*\*Typically applicable to parental or sibling samples during clinical family evaluations.*

#### Evidence Strength Thresholds

`ClinGen_ACMG_Specifications_MAP2K1_v2.3.pdf` defines:

| Total Points | Strength Level |
|--------------|----------------|
| -1 point (operator unstated) | Supporting (BS2_Supporting) |
| -4 points (operator unstated) | Strong (BS2) |

`BS2 Scoring.jpg` defines:

| Total Points | Strength Level |
|--------------|----------------|
| -1 point (operator unstated) | Supporting (BS2_Supporting) |
| N/A | Moderate (not applicable) |
| -3.0 points (operator unstated) | Strong (BS2) |

**Modification Type:** Strength

> **Source contradiction (unresolved):** BS2 Strong is -4 points in the PDF but -3.0 points in the attached image. Neither source supplies an inclusive or strict comparator. The prior `≤` interpretation was not source-supported and has been removed.

---

### BS3 - Functional Studies (No Effect)

**Original ACMG Summary:** Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.

**VCEP Specification:** *Not Applicable*

**Comments:** Approved functional studies are available for each individual gene in the supplemental material. Additional functional studies can be submitted to the expert panel for approval. Both approved MAP2K1 assay columns in `Approved Functional Studies.xlsx` explicitly state BS3_NA.

---

### BS4 - Lack of Segregation

**Original ACMG Summary:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.

**Caveat:** The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e. cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.

**VCEP Specifications:** Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong (BS4)** | Requires only one informative meiosis |

**Modification Type:** General recommendation

---

### BP1-BP7 - Benign Supporting

| Criterion | Status | Specification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **BP1** | Applicable | Truncating, LOF variant in a gene for which primarily missense, GOF variants are known to cause disease. **Supporting:** This rule has contraindications for use with RASopathies. Given the disease mechanism is gain-of-function for RASopathies, BP1 should be used for any truncating variant (nonsense, frameshift, affects canonical splice sites, initiation codon, entire gene or multi-exon deletion) in genes without established LOF correlation to disease. See supplemental material regarding dosage sensitivity information. |
| **BP2** | Applicable | Points are awarded for an alternative molecular cause of a RASopathy in the same gene (and/or in conjunction with BP5) and the phenotype is consistent with expected severity of the RASopathy. **Strong:** ≥(-4) Points; **Moderate:** ≥(-2) Points; **Supporting:** ≥(-1) Point |
| **BP3** | Not Applicable | No known benign repetitive areas in RASopathy genes. |
| **BP4** | Applicable | For missense variants: REVEL ≤0.3. For splicing variants: predicted outcome is negligible or does not match disease mechanism. **Supporting:** For missense variants: REVEL ≤0.3. |
| **BP5** | Applicable | Points are awarded for an alternative molecular cause of a RASopathy in a different gene (and/or in conjunction with BP2) and the phenotype is consistent with expected severity of the RASopathy. Points are also awarded for phenotypes inconsistent with a RASopathy and fully explained by a different causative variant (e.g. WES testing). **Strong:** ≥(-4) Points; **Moderate:** ≥(-2) Points; **Supporting:** ≥(-1) Point |
| **BP6** | Not Applicable | This criterion is not for use as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation VCEP Review Committee. (PMID: 29543229) |
| **BP7** | Applicable | A synonymous (silent) variant for which splicing prediction algorithms predict no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved. This rule is also applicable for intronic positions (except canonical splice sites) or non-coding variants and should be used in conjunction with BP4. |

> **Unavailable referenced material (BP1):** The specification refers to supplemental dosage-sensitivity information, but no dosage-sensitivity document is present in the complete distributed MAP2K1 package. No MAP2K1-specific dosage claim is inferred.

> **Source presentation note (BP4):** The PDF's VCEP summary includes both the missense and splicing rules, while its Supporting row repeats only the missense rule. Both source statements are retained without treating the shorter row as a retraction.

#### BP5/BP2 Point System (Per Individual)

| Phenotypic Consistency | Points per Individual |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Phenotype inconsistent with a RASopathy and causative variant has been identified, **-or-** Molecular cause of a RASopathy is identified in a different RASopathy gene, **-or-** Molecular cause of a RASopathy is identified in *trans* or *cis* with the variant being classified | -1 |
| Phenotype inconsistent with a RASopathy and no causative variant identified/reported | 0 |

#### BP5/BP2 Evidence Strength Thresholds

`ClinGen_ACMG_Specifications_MAP2K1_v2.3.pdf` defines both BP2 and BP5 as:

| Total Points | Strength Level |
|--------------|----------------|
| ≥(-1) | Supporting |
| ≥(-2) | Moderate |
| ≥(-4) | Strong |

`BP5_BP2 Scoring.jpg` instead defines:

| Total Points | Strength Level |
|--------------|----------------|
| -1 point (operator unstated) | Supporting (BP5/BP2) |
| N/A | Moderate (not applicable) |
| -3.0 points (operator unstated) | Strong (BP5_Strong/BP2_Strong) |

> **Source contradiction (unresolved):** The PDF and image disagree on whether Moderate is available and on the Strong value. The image supplies no comparator, while the PDF explicitly uses `≥`. The prior `≤` interpretation of the image was not source-supported and has been removed.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Analogous Residues (MAP2K1 and MAP2K2)

MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 are highly homologous genes. Analogous residue positions can be used to support PS1 and PM5 criteria.

| Gene | Protein Accession |
|------|-------------------|
| MAP2K1 | NP_002746.1 |
| MAP2K2 | NP_109587.1 |

*Refer to the supplementary file "Analogous Residues" for the complete alignment and mapping of analogous residues between MAP2K1 and MAP2K2.*

The visible `MAP2K Alignment` sheet contains two embedded alignment images spanning MAP2K1 (393 amino acids) and MAP2K2 (400 amino acids). It does not identify pathogenic residues or provide an approved codon-by-codon PM5 list.

> **Package scope note:** The workbook's two hidden sheets, `SOS variants from HGMD` and `SOS variants case counts`, contain SOS1/SOS2 data and unfinished notes. They are unrelated to the MAP2K1/MAP2K2 alignment and are not MAP2K1 evidence.

### Appendix B: Population Frequency Thresholds Summary

| Criterion | Threshold | Strength |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| BA1 | ≥0.05% | Stand Alone |
| BS1 | ≥0.025% | Strong |
| PM2 | Absent from gnomAD | Supporting |

**Note:** Use gnomAD filtering allele frequency for all population frequency assessments.

### Appendix C: Source-Defined PM1 Ranges

| Amino Acid Range | Applicable Criterion |
|------------------|---------------------|
| AA 43–61 | PM1 (Moderate) |
| AA 124–134 | PM1 (Moderate) |

### Appendix D: Approved Functional Assays Summary

| Assay | PS3 Strength | BS3 Strength | Gene Applicability |
|-------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| MEK Activation Assay | Supporting | Not Applicable | MAP2K1 |
| ERK Activation Assay | Supporting | Not Applicable | MAP2K1 |

Two or more different approved assay types for the same variant support PS3_Moderate.

### Appendix E: Point-Based Scoring Summary

#### De Novo (PS2/PM6) Evidence Strength

| Points | Evidence Level |
|--------|----------------|
| 0.5 | Supporting |
| 1.0 | Moderate |
| 2.0 | Strong |
| 4.0 | Very Strong |

The image prints exact values without operators and names PS2_Supporting and PM6_VeryStrong, which the PDF does not define.

#### Case Counting (PS4) Evidence Strength

| Points | Evidence Level |
|--------|----------------|
| 1.0 | Supporting |
| 3.0 | Moderate |
| 5.0 | Strong |

The inclusive `≥` comparators are supplied by the PDF body; the image prints only exact values.

#### Healthy Individual (BS2) Evidence Strength — Conflicting Sources

| Source | Supporting | Moderate | Strong |
|--------|------------|----------|--------|
| Specification PDF | -1, operator unstated | Not defined | -4, operator unstated |
| `BS2 Scoring.jpg` | -1, operator unstated | N/A | -3, operator unstated |

#### Alternative Molecular Cause (BP5/BP2) Evidence Strength — Conflicting Sources

| Source | Supporting | Moderate | Strong |
|--------|------------|----------|--------|
| Specification PDF | ≥(-1) | ≥(-2) | ≥(-4) |
| `BP5_BP2 Scoring.jpg` | -1, operator unstated | N/A | -3, operator unstated |

## Version History

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| 2.3.0 | 2026-08-07 | **Document corrections.** Restored the PM5_Strong source typo and `observed in ≥5 probands` qualifier and documented BP4's split presentation from `ClinGen_ACMG_Specifications_MAP2K1_v2.3.pdf`; removed invented BS2 and BP2/BP5 `≤` comparators and reported the unresolved scoring conflicts verified against the PDF, `BS2 Scoring.jpg`, `BP5_BP2 Scoring.jpg`, `PS2_PM6 Scoring.jpg`, and `PS4 Scoring.jpg`; transcribed MAP2K1 assay citations, controls, readouts, strengths, and control-row inconsistencies from `Approved Functional Studies.xlsx`; verified both embedded alignment images and excluded the unrelated hidden SOS sheets in `Analogous Residues.xlsx`; marked the unverified PM1 range names with the required warning and replaced the source-contradicting all-RASopathy assay claim; documented the absent BP1 dosage-sensitivity attachment after checking the complete package. |
| 2.3.0 | December 3, 2024 | Submitting Pilot Rules. All pilot variants are attached in the LZTR1 submission. "Observed in ≥5 probands" removed from PM5 at Moderate strength. |
